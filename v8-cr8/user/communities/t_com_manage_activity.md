# Keeping your community activities up-to-date {#t_com_manage_activity .concept}

Edit the details of your community activities to reflect your current goals and tasks.

**Note:** Community owners cannot manage tasks for any activities that are shared with a community. Only the activity owner who shared the activity with the community can manage that activity.

You can manage activities in many ways, for example assigning a priority, editing its details, or using it as a template for a new activity:

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community whose activities you want to manage.
2.  In the community menu, click **Activities** then select the activity you want to manage.
3.  Click **Activity Actions** to see your options. Some tasks you can perform are as follows:
    -   To edit basic information about an activity, such as its title, goal, and tags, select **Edit Activity** from the list.
    -   To use the activity as a template for new activities, select **Copy as New Template**.
    -   To link the activity to another activity within the community or from your own list, select **Add Related Activity**.
    -   To export the activity as a CSV file, click **Export Activity**. The following fields from each activity are saved: Ordering, Section, Parent entry, Completed, Title, Type, Last updated, Last updater, Tags, Assigned to, Due date, Description, Attachment, Bookmark, Custom text, Custom person, and Custom date.
