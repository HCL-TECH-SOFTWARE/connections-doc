Disseminate resources and information more efficiently for your community.

-   **[Assigning tasks in a community activity](../communities/t_com_use_activities_widget.md)**  
Add activities to your community so you can assign tasks to members and share information and resources. You can grant access to the activity to all community members, or you can restrict access to a subset of members.
-   **[Bookmarking important places](../communities/community_bookmarks_frame.md)**  
Have you seen something on the web that you'd like to share? Bookmark the site to make it available to community members.
-   **[Scheduling events](../communities/community_events_frame.md)**  
Use the Events app to share information about important events and dates relating to your community.
-   **[Adding a feed to a community](../communities/t_com_feed_adding.md)**
