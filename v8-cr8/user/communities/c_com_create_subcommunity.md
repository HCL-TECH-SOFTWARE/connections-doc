# Creating subcommunities to reflect organizational change {#concept_trn_ch5_1y .concept}

Create a subcommunity to bring together a subset of members within an existing community for a specific purpose.

## What can members do in a subcommunity? { .section}

When you create a subcommunity, you and any other community owners automatically become owners of that subcommunity.

## Creating a subcommunity { .section}

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community to which you want to add a subcommunity.
2.  Click **Community Actions** and select **Create Subcommunity** from the list.
3.  Enter the details of your subcommunity. The most important is the Subcommunity Type, which defines the subcommunity's access level. The access options depend on the access level of the parent community.
    -   When the parent community is **Public to my organization**, the subcommunity can be public, moderated, or restricted.
    -   When the parent community is **Moderated**, the subcommunity can be moderated or restricted.
    -   When the parent community is **Restricted**, the subcommunity must also be restricted.
4.  Click **Create**.

## Some tips { .section}

A subcommunity cannot be more visible than its parent. Therefore, if a parent community does not have **Let anyone in my organization see the community's logo, name, description, tags, and owners** selected in the parent community's profile setting, the subcommunity cannot have this set either.

You cannot change the **External access** setting for a new subcommunity as well. All subcommunities have the same setting for external access as the parent community.

## Accessing subcommunities { .section}

You can easily access subcommunities in the following ways:

-   From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and browse for the subcommunity. You can click the **Filter by** icon ![Filter by icon](images/filter.png) and select **I'm an Owner** or **I'm a Member** from the list.
-   If the Subcommunities app is added to the parent community, you can the subcommunities on the parent's **Highlights** page.
-   From the parent community page, beside the parent name, select the drop-down list. The list shows the subcommunities so you can quickly open one from the parent community.
