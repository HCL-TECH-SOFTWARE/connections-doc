# Getting ideas flowing with an ideation blog {#t_com_manage_ideationblog .concept}

Tap into the creativity of your members and encourage them to brainstorm, develop, and refine ideas using an ideation blog.

An ideation blog is a type of blog that is designed to generate ideas on a particular topic, collect feedback, and reach a consensus on the best ideas. An ideation blog can only exist within a community and membership is limited to the community, but you can manage its settings from your **My Blogs** page. A community can contain multiple ideation blogs.
