# Using the Blogs app {#t_hp_using_blogs_widget .task}

Use the Blogs app to view the latest updates to blog entries.

The Blogs app displays information about the most recent blog entries in your organization, in order of the most recently published entry. You can see how many people liked a blog entry or commented on it.

-   You can work with the Blogs app in the following ways:
-   To view a blog update, click the blog title to open the update. Alternatively, click **Details** to open the blog entry in a pop-up window.

-   If no blog entries have been created yet, click **Go to your Blogs page** and create a new blog or start adding blog entries.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
