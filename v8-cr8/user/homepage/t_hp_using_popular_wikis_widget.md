# Using the Popular Wikis app {#t_hp_using_popular_wikis_widget .task}

Use the Popular Wikis app to see a list of popular wikis that have been updated recently.

The Popular Wikis app displays a list of the wikis that receive the greatest number of visits, in order of the most recently-updated wiki. The app lists the wikis by title, and provides information about who last updated the wiki and when they made the update.

-   You can work with the Popular Wikis app in the following ways:
-   To navigate to a wiki to get more information about an update, click the wiki title to open the wiki in the Wikis app. Close the window to return to the Home page.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
