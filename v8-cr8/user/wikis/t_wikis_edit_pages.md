# Editing wiki pages {#howdoieditotherpeoplespages .concept}

To edit wiki pages, you must have Owner or Editor access to the wiki. If you have Reader access only, ask the wiki owner or a member with owner access to give you Editor access.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Wikis** and select the wiki you want to work on.
2.  Select the page you want to edit in the side panel, then click **Edit**.

    **Note:** If the Edit button is disabled, see [Working with wiki pages](../communities/t_com_wiki_pages.md) for more information.

3.  Edit the content in either the **Rich Text** tab or **HTML Source** tab. To use the HTML editor, you must be familiar with HTML code.

When you save the edited page, the changes are saved in a new version of the page. To see the different versions, click **Versions** at the foot of the page.

## Good to know {#section_ld4_gzs_j5b .section}

Using the rich text editor, you can add a variety of content to keep your post engaging and informative. For example, you can add a table to organize your content, as well as images and videos to visualize your ideas. For more on rich text editing, see [Using the rich text editor](../eucommon/eucommon_ckeditor.md).
