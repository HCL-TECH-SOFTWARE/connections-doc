Entries are the most flexible components of an activity. They can be made to fit any situation by using custom fields.

## Assign an entry { .section}

Entries do not have a preset assignment field. You can create one yourself by adding a custom field.

1.  Open your entry.
2.  Click **Add Custom Fields** \> **Person Field**.
3.  Assign a member of your team.
4.  Click **Save**.

## Add a due date to an entry { .section}

Entries do not have a preset due date field. You can create one yourself by adding a custom field.

1.  Open your entry.
2.  Click **Add Custom Fields** \> **Date Field**.
3.  Click the date field to display the calendar and select a due date.
4.  Replace the **Date** field title with Due Date.
5.  Click **Save**.

## Notify people of an entry { .section}

Notifications are not sent to members automatically. You must manually select an option after each edit.

1.  Open your entry.
2.  Click **Notify people of this entry**.
3.  Select people to notify.
4.  Click **Save**.
