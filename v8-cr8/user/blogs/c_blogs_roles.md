# Managing roles and permissions {#c_blogs_roles .concept}

What you can do with blog settings or content depends on your role. Community owners can expand or restrict members' permissions, and add or remove members.

-   View, create, edit, or delete all content \(entries and comments in both the draft and published state\) for a blog they own.
-   View, create, and delete all links in the blog.
-   Upload files and create directories and view or delete any uploaded file or directory.
-   View and edit settings for the blog, such as General and Authors settings.

## Author permissions {#section_lb5_hjp_my .section}

Blog authors can:

-   View, create, edit, or delete blog entries that they created, regardless of whether the entries are in the draft state or posted to the blog.
-   View, create, edit, or delete links.
-   Upload files and create directories and view or delete any uploaded file or directory they added to the blog.

## Draft permissions {#section_qmq_jjp_my .section}

Draft authors can:

-   View, create, edit, or delete a blog draft entry that they own.
