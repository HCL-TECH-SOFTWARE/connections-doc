# Adding more owners to a forum {#t_forums_add_owners .task}

If you are the Forums administrator or a forum owner, you can add more owners to a forum to share the responsibilities of forum ownership.

1.  To add more owners to a forum, complete the following steps:
2.  From the **Forums** tab on the I'm an Owner page, open the forum to which you want to add new owners.

3.  In the Owner area, click **Add Owners**.

4.  Enter the names of the people who you want to add as owners in the field provided.

    As you enter names, the type-ahead function predicts the name that you are typing by comparing it to names in your company directory. If it proposes the name that you want, click the name to add it. If the name is not listed, click **Person not listed? Use full search** to search the company directory.

5.  Click **OK** to add the new owners.


If you want to remove owners from the forum, clicking the ![Remove this member icon](removeOwner.png) icon near their names in the **Owner** area.
