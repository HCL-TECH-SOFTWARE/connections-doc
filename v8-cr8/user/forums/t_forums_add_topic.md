# Adding forum topics {#t_forums_add_topic .task}

Start a discussion with people in your organization by creating a forum topic. Anyone who can access Forums can view the new topic.

1.  To create a new forum topic, view a Forum you wish to add a topic to from **Public Forums**, forums you **Owned**, or you are a **Member** of. Click **Start a Topic** and complete the topic form.

    You can enhance your topic by styling the text, adding images, or attaching files. If you are looking for an answer, mark the topic as a question.

2.  To post a web page as a forum topic, follow these steps.

    1.  Open the Forums application, click **Bookmarking Tools** in the page footer, and follow the instructions for adding the **Discuss This** button to your browser.

    2.  In the page header, select **Apps** \> **Downloads and Setup** and follow the instructions on the Downloads and Setup page to add **Discuss This** to your browser.

    3.  Go to a web page that you want to add to a forum and click **Discuss This**.

    4.  Click **Save** to save your topic.


If forum topics are moderated in your organization, the new content is not displayed immediately because the forum moderator must approve it first. If content moderation is not enabled, the topic is displayed immediately.
