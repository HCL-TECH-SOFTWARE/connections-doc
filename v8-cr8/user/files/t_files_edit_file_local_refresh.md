# Editing a Connections file in Microsoft Office 

If you have the HCL Connections Desktop Plug-ins for Microsoft Windows installed and configured, you can do [roundtrip editing of Connections files](../../admin/admin/t_admin_enabling_roundtrip_edit.md): check out a file from Connections, edit it locally in Word, and then check it back in. The file you want to edit must be a file that you own or a file that has been shared with you and for which Editor access has been assigned.

To install the Connections Desktop Plug-ins for Microsoft Windows, refer to [Connections Desktop Plug-ins for Microsoft Windows](../../connectors/enduser/c_files_window_install_ovr.md).

1.  Locate the file you want to edit and click to open its file page.

2.  Click **Edit on Desktop**.

3.  If this is the first time you are accessing a file using the Connections Desktop Plug-ins for Microsoft Windows:

    1.  You are prompted to register the file launcher.

    2.  Enter your user name and password at the prompt. Select **Login**.

    3.  In the **Open Document** window, select the **Open for editing** option. If you want to avoid this prompt in the future, select **Remember my selection for this library.**.

4.  If you have previously accessed a file using the Connections Desktop Plug-ins for Microsoft Windows:

    1.  The file opens directly for editing, when you are finished with your changes, save and close the file.

5.  In the Publish Changes window, click **Publish**.

6.  When the publishing is complete, close the editor.


On the file page, the version information is updated to show the version created by your changes.
