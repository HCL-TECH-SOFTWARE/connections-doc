# Moving files and folders {#task_tdd_fzf_hy .concept}

Move one or multiple files and folders easily from one location to another. For files, you must have Owner or Editor access to the file and the destination folder. For folders, you must have Owner or Editor access to the file, source folder, and destination folder.

## Moving a file { .section}

Make sure you have Owner or Editor access to the file and destination folder. To move a file, do either of the following:

-   Drag and drop the file to its new location.
-   Use the **Move To** option:
    1.  From the navigation bar, click **Files**.
    2.  Open the folder containing the file you want to move.
    3.  Select the checkbox next to the file you want to move, then click **Move To** in the action bar.
    4.  Select a destination in the Move to window.
    5.  Click **Move here**.

## Limitations for moving files { .section}

-   Files that are shared only internally can't be moved to a folder that external users can access.
-   Non-public files that you do not own can't be moved to a public folder.
-   If your file's new location contains another file with the same name, you can upload the file as a new version of the other file or rename the file to keep both files.
-   If a subset of the selected files to be moved are ineligible, then the move will fail.

## Moving a folder { .section}

Make sure you have Owner or Editor access to the file, source folder, and destination folder. To move a folder, do either of the following:

-   Drag and drop the folder to its new location.
-   Use the **Move To** option:
    1.  From the navigation bar, click **Files**.
    2.  In the sidebar, select the folder that you want to move.
    3.  Click the arrow next to the folder name in the action bar, then select **Move To**.
    4.  Select a destination in the Move to window.
    5.  Click **Move here**.

If you're moving a folder into a community, note that it might cause others to lose access to the folder and its contents, unless the source and destination folders are community-owned.

## Limitations for moving folders { .section}

**Moving a non-public folder into a public folder**

If any files in the source folder are not visible to everyone in your organization, a warning message is displayed. The warning message indicates that the files not visible to everyone in your organization will be removed and will not be moved to the destination folder. You are prompted to complete the move or cancel it.

**Moving a folder into another folder accessed by different users**

If a folder contains files that cannot be shared by other users, and you do not own those files, those folders are not moved. An error message is displayed that indicates that one or more folders were not moved because they contain files that the owner does not allow others to share.
