# Managing file versions {#ms_desktop_plugins_filesync_version .task}

View and retrieve earlier versions of a file.

When you initially upload a file you create a first version. When you or someone else edits the file so that the server copy is different from the local copy, a new version is created. All previous versions are maintained. Versions can be deleted.

To view versions, right-click a file and select **HCL Connections** then click the **Versions** tab. You can see information including the version number, when it was updated, and the person who made the updates. You can restore a previous version to make it the latest version. A new version is generated if you restore a file from an older version. Removing and restoring versions are only available as options if you have "editor" version permission for a file.

-   To work with file versions, do any of the following in the Versions list:
-   To permanently remove a version, select the version that is not the current version and click the **minus** button.

-   To make a past version the current version, select a past version and click the gear button to access the action menu. Choose **Restore** from the menu to make that version the current version.

-   To open a version in an editor, click a version that is not the current version and click the gear button to access the action menu. Choose **Download this version**.

-   If you edit a previous version and save the file, you are prompted to overwrite the most recent version of the file, merge your changes, or rename the file and save it as a new file.
