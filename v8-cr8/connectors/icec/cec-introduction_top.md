Connections Engagement Center is a single, accessible hub for organizational news and content within HCL Connections, enabling users to create and manage web content efficiently. People get engaged with finding, creating, owning, and promoting content to improve intranet communication. All content can be found in one place. Communication and collaboration are on the same page or one click away. Connections Engagement Center makes it simple and easy for users to create content; there's no need for multiple systems to create and publish content. This documentation explains and describes role concepts, site structure, functions of the various Connections Engagement Center features and their usage and configuration.

-   **[Get started](../../connectors/icec/cec_getstarted.md)**  
Connections Engagement Center makes it easy way to build a social intranet by creating a portal-like experience using various out-of-the-box and custom widgets. Engagement Center does not have its own content store, but aggregates content from different backend systems. Mostly, HCL Connections is the back-end system, since it is the underlying foundation for a set of key Engagement Center services, such as user authentication and authorization, personalization, top-level navigation, and news.
-   **[Roles](../../connectors/icec/cec-roles.md)**  
Connections Engagement Center has multiple user roles that provide increasing levels of access.
-   **[Adding the Communities widget to your organization Adding the Engagement Center widget to a Community](../../connectors/icec/cec-communities.md)**

The extension makes the Connections Engagement Center widget available so that Community owners can add it to a Community. Community owners can add the Connections Engagement Center widget to a Community in the same way they would add any other widget or app by using the **Community Actions** menu.
