# ATOM/RSS feed {#id_name .reference}

This widget allows you to include elements from other web sites. You can show RSS or ATOM Feeds from external sites within that widget.

**Note:** Be sure that you have configured the AJAX-Proxy \(Connections Engagement Center - Installation Instructions\).

As of Connections Engagement Center v11 this widget allows enriching the displayed content with the Rich RSS Option. With that option you may display images from the target resources within the RSS widget.

**Caution:** the Rich RSS option will not work for all RSS widgets. In order to use this option the OEmbed Service needs to be configured. Additionally not all Websites provide information consumable by the OEmbed service. You need to check on a per-feed decision if the rich option works for your use case.

As of Connections Engagement Center v11 this widget allows for personalizing the pulled feeds.
