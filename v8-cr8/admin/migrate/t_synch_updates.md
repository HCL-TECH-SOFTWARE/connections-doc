# Synchronizing nodes {#t_synch_updates .task}

Synchronize all the nodes in a cluster.

Ensure that synchronization is enabled. For more information, see *Enabling and disabling synchronization*.

After you update or change your deployment, you might need to synchronize those changes to the nodes in your deployment.

To synchronize the nodes, complete the following steps:

1.  Log in to the WebSphere® Application Server Integrated Solutions Console for the Deployment Manager and click **System Administration** \> **Nodes**.

2.  Select the check boxes for the nodes and click **Full Resynchronize**.

3.  Click **Save**.

4.  Restart WebSphere Application Server .
