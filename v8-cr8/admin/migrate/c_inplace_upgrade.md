# In-place and hybrid upgrades {#c_inplace_upgrade .concept}

With the Update function in IBM Installation Manager, you can upgrade the existing version of Connections to the next version, either in your production environment or in a in a new environment identical to production.

The following topics provide planning information and upgrade procedures.

-   **[Considerations for an in-place or hybrid upgrade](../migrate/c_inplace_upgrade_considerations.md)**  
 Both the in-place and hybrid approach use the Update function in IBM Installation Manager to apply Connections 8.0 and the latest CR updates to a 7.0 server, preserving some of the existing configuration settings.
-   **[Performing an in-place or hybrid upgrade](../migrate/t_upgrading_to_7.md)**  
 Upgrade to an HCL Connections 8.0 and the latest CR deployment by running the Installation Manager Update function on a Connections 7.0 deployment. This can be done either in-place \(in your existing production environment\) or using a hybrid approach of installing 7.0 in a new environment identical to production then running the upgrade to 7.0.
<!---   **[Updating databases](../migrate/t_update_databases-manual.md)**
