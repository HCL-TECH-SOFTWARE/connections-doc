# Administering community templates {#t_admin_comm_templates_container .concept}

If your organization deployed Component Pack for Connections 7.0, you can take advantage of the community templates feature that is part of the tailored experience for Connections oganizations.

By creating community templates from existing communities, new communities can get productive more quickly. Your organization can achieve the following results:

-   A consistent look-and-feel across your organization's communities
-   Repeatable projects that rely on similar patterns of collaboration
-   Content reuse in some apps like files, blogs, and wikis

Template adminisrators create and manage community templates from a new, GUI-based adminstration console for Component Pack features.

## Before you begin {#section_d2k_3zr_spb .section}

Make sure your organization has completed the these tasks:

-   [Installing or upgrading Component Pack](../install/cp_install_services_tasks.md), making sure to include the setup for Tailored Experience features for communities
-   [Configuring the community creation wizard](../install/t_configure_community_wizard.md)

Then use the following topics to help you understand and implement community templates for your users:

-   **[Assigning administrators to template management roles](../admin/t_admin_comm_templates_assign_admins.md)**  
Assigning the function of community template administrator requires access to the system where the Connections applications are installed, and assigning that of template content owner requires the IBM WebSphere Application Server administrative console.
-   **[Things to know before creating a community template](../admin/c_things_to_know_before_create_community_template.md)**  
As a community template administrator, learn what results to expect when you use the [HCL Connections Administration Console](t_admin_comm_templates_manage.md) to create a template.
-   **[Managing community templates](../admin/t_admin_comm_templates_manage.md)**  
With the HCL Connections Administration Console, you can manage Connections features that rely on microservices provided by Component Pack for Connections, such as the community template catalog and templates that you can edit.
