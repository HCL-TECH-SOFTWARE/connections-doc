# Search index directory structure {#c_admin_search_folder_structure .concept}

Each HCL Connections application has its own index directory. The Search index directory is defined by the WebSphereÂ® Application Server variable SEARCH\_INDEX\_DIR.

The application-specific index directories are named index\_application\_name.

|Application|Index directory|
|-----------|---------------|
|Activities|index\_activities|
|Blogs|index\_blogs|
|Bookmarks|index\_bookmarks|
|Calendar|index\_calendar|
|Communities|index\_communities|
|Community Libraries|index\_ecm\_files|
|Files|index\_files|
|Forums|index\_forums|
|People finder|index\_people\_finder|
|Profiles|index\_profiles|
|Social analytics|index\_sand|
|Status updates|index\_status\_updates|
|Wikis|index\_wikis|

Each index directory contains doctype, facets, filesTemp, and graph files. After the index is built, each directory also contains an INDEX.READY file and a CRAWLING\_VERSION file.

The following directories are also used by the Search application:

index\_backup
:   When the SearchService.backupIndexNow\(\) command is run, the index is backed up to the index\_backup directory. This directory is contained in the data\\local\\search folder. The folder location is specified by the WebSphere Application Server variable SEARCH\_INDEX\_BACKUP\_DIR.

staging
:   After the initial index is built, it is copied to the staging directory before it is rolled out to all the nodes in the deployment. This directory is located on the network share. The directory location is specified by the WebSphere Application Server variable SEARCH\_INDEX\_SHARED\_COPY\_LOCATION. An index in this directory is deleted 30 days after it is created. If you want to disable the automatic roll-out behavior, you must delete the WebSphere variable SEARCH\_INDEX\_SHARED\_COPY\_LOCATION. If you delete this variable, you must also clear the existing contents of SEARCH\_INDEX\_SHARED\_COPY\_LOCATION manually.

persistence
:   The persistence directory contains the XML files that are created after an application is crawled. These files are used to build an index for the application. This directory is contained in the data\\local\\search folder. The directory location is specified by the WebSphere Application Server variable CRAWLER\_PAGE\_PERSISTENCE\_DIR.

extracted
:   The extracted directory holds documents that contain the content extracted from files. This directory is located on the network share. The directory location is specified by the WebSphere Application Server variable EXTRACTED\_FILE\_STORE.
