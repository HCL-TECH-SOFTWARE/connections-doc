# Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) for Wikis {#search_engine_optimization_wikis .concept}

Manage Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) so that your public wiki content is available from internet search engines and achieves a higher ranking in searches.

Your public wikis are already optimized for search engines. By default, HCL Connections generates a sitemap of your public wiki pages that you can submit to search engines.

**Tip:** To improve the process of search engine optimization, use HTTP compression for your site. HTTP compression decreases the time that is required to download a webpage to a browser. Most webservers, including IBMÂ® HTTP Server, use compression by default but you can check that it is enabled by asking your administrator.

The following topics explain how to submit the sitemap and configure your SEO settings:

-   **[Enabling or disabling SEO](../admin/t_admin_wikis_enable_or_disable_seo.md)**

-   **[Submitting a sitemap for SEO](../admin/t_admin_wikis_submit_sitemap_SEO.md)**  
Submit a sitemap to a search engine provider.
-   **[Securing SEO](../admin/t_admin_wikis_secure_SEO.md)**  
Control access to the sitemap that is used for search engine optimization.
