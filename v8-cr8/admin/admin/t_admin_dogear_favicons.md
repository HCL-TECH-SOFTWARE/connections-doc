# Changing the default favicon {#ic_admin_dogear_filter_active_content .task}

You can change the default favicon for a Bookmarks deployment.

Icons for bookmarks give users a visual guide to different bookmarks. You can manage many of the settings for how bookmark icons display in your deployment.

HCL Connections supplies a default icon for bookmarks that are not associated with an icon. When you bookmark a page that does not have an icon associated with it, the default icon, default.gif, is placed in the favorite folder where the Bookmarks service is installed. For example, C:\\Program files\\IBM\\Connections\\Data\\dogear\\favorite on a WindowsÂ® installation.

-   To customize the default icon for your HCL Connections deployment, replace the default.gif file with the one you want to use.

-   To revert to the default, delete the default.gif file and the Bookmarks service will recreate the default file the next time a default icon is requested.
