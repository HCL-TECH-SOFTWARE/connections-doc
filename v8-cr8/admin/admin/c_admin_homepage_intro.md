# Administering the Home page {#c_admin_homepage_intro .concept}

You can administer site-wide settings for the Home page from the Home page administration user interface or using the wsadmin client.

Home page administration information is contained in the widget catalog, which resides in the HOMEPAGE database. The catalog defines the widgets that have been deployed in the Home page. It also specifies whether the widgets are enabled or disabled, and sets out any prerequisites that the widgets have on HCL Connections applications. The catalog is administered using the Administration view in the Home page user interface. For more information about administering the widget catalog, see *Administering the Home page from the user interface*.

You can also perform a number of administrative tasks for the Home page from the wsadmin client, for example, synchronizing member IDs between the Home page and the LDAP directory.
