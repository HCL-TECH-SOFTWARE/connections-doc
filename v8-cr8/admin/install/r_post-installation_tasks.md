# Post-installation tasks {#c .reference}

After installation, you need to perform further tasks to ensure an efficient deployment.

## Tasks to be completed { .section}

After running the wizards to install applications and create databases, check which of the following additional tasks you need to complete.

Some post-installation tasks are mandatory while others are optional and depend on your deployment choices. Unless *optional* is indicated, any listed post-installation task should be considered mandatory.

**Important:** Once you complete the mandatory tasks, update the deployment with the latest fixes. For more information, see the [Updating Connections 8.0 with the latest fixes](../migrate/c_updating_interim_fixes.md) topic in the *Migrating and updating* section of this guide.
