# Integrating with Activities Plus {#cp_3p_install_upgrade_intro .concept}

Huddo \(formerly Kudos\) Activities Plus is the team collaboration tool \(replacement of Connections Activities\) from Huddo Boards that makes work easier and more intuitive.

With Activities Plus, your users can view an activity as a board, giving them the option to drag and drop their Tasks and Entries and filter the content of their boards by person, by priority, by color, and more. Existing Connections activities can be converted and imported to boards, where users can continue to work in a more modern and effective way.

Activities Plus uses the existing Component Pack infrastructure \(Docker/Kubernetes cluster\), and is seamlessly integrated with Connections on-premises applications such as Communities, Files, Homepage \(Orient Me\), and the Connections mobile application. Activities Plus uses the Mongo database already deployed inside the Component Pack.

**Note:** Activities Plus is not integrated with the Connections Ideation Blog app used in Connections Communities. The Ideation Blog feature that generates a community activity when members "graduate" ideas from an ideation blog does not work in Activities Plus.
