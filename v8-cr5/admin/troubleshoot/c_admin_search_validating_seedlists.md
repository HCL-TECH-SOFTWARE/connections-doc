# Validating Search seedlists {#c_admin_search_validating_seedlists .concept}

If you experience problems when indexing, you can validate Search seedlists to help you identify the source of the problem. You can validate Search seedlists using the browser or the wsadmin client.

Use your browser to verify that the Search seedlists for the applications in your deployment are working as expected. If you are seeing problems in the log file, accessing the seedlist in the browser can help to narrow down the root cause of the problems.
