# Installing silently {#installingsilently .concept}

Silent installation is a tool to simplify the installation process in enterprises that need multiple, identical instances of HCL Connections™.

Silent installation uses installation parameters in a response file to install identical HCL Connections profiles on different computers. To specify silent installation parameters you can edit the default response file provided with HCL Connections, or create a new file.

In addition to silently installing HCL Connections, you can use the silent installation process to modify, update, or uninstall HCL Connections.
