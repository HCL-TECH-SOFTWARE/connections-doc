# Suspending file sync {#ms_desktop_plugins_filesync_suspend .task}

To suspend file sync temporarily, turn off syncing for a sync folder.

You may want to turn off file syncing temporarily, for example, if you are making a lot of changes to files and want to sync when the changes are complete. To stop sync, you must remove the account.

-   To suspend sync activities temporarily, click the HCL Connections icon in the menu bar or right-click the icon in the Dock and choose **Display-name My Drive** \> **Suspend sync**.

    You can resume sync later by choosing **Display-name My Drive** \> **Resume sync**.

-   To turn off syncing from the server, click on the HCL Connections icon in the menu bar or right-click the icon in the Dock and select **Preferences** from the menu. Select the account in the Accounts sidebar that you want to stop syncing and click the **minus** icon. Click **Remove this Account** from the dialog box. Removing an account does not delete any content. The contents of the associated sync folder are copied to a new folder and the server and all sub-folders are removed from your HCL Connections folder.

-   To stop syncing a file or folder you can remove it from My Drive. Note that removing a file or folder from My Drive does not delete the file or folder. Also, if a file is in more than one location in My Drive, for example if you add the file to My Drive and then later add a folder containing the file to My Drive, you must remove all of the instances of the file from My Drive to turn off syncing for the file.
