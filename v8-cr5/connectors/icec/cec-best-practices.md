# Best practices {#id_name .reference}

Most of the content displayed by Connections Engagement Center pages will be created and maintained within HCL Connections. Therefore we provide some useful best practices in this area to guide your editorial teams to an effective content creation process.

-   **[Roles and restrictions in source communities](../../connectors/icec/cec-roles-restrictions.md)**  
If widgets are set to display the **latest** content of a Community each new post within this community will be displayed on the corresponding Connections Engagement Center page. This enables an easy content creation process. To make sure that only a defined set of people are allowed to publish content within this sources there are different options.
-   **[Picture guidelines](../../connectors/icec/cec-picture-guidelines.md)**  
The different news widgets display pictures in various ways. Depending on the CI adaption and the layout there should be maintenance guidelines in place to ensure a consistent layout.
