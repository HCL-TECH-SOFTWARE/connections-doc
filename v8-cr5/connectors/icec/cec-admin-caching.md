# Caching for Admins {#concept_pck_n52_gcb .concept}

Caching increases performance. Each **User all** request from the Connections Engagement Center is cached for 15 minutes if Admin caching is enabled.

However, sometimes this results in confusion. For example, if the editor publishes a new blog entry and it is not shown directly on the Connections Engagement Center pages. Disable **Caching for Admins** to see new blog entries immediately.

Find this setting in the Admin Dashboard. The Admin Dashboard is reachable through the URL: \[your\_domain\]/xcc/admin. The Admin Dashboard can be reached through the URL: apps.\[yourLocale\].collabserv.com/xcc/admin.
