# Configure image for widget titles {#id_name .reference}

You can configure a widget to display an image as widget title by pasting an html img-tag into the input field for the title in the widget editor.

The image can easily be uploaded to the Connections Engagement Center customization files in the Admin Panel.

![image](images/image042.png)

The path of the image is always the same if you uploaded it to the Connections Engagement Center. You only need to change the name of the file, e.g. **/http/rest/public/custom/filename.extension**

The image will by default be displayed in full-width without any padding.

If you want to position a text on the image, please use the following code in addition to the code example:

`<span>Text</span>`
