3.  Assign a member of your team.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Within your new entry, click **Add To-Do Item**.
6.  Add as many as you need.

## Group by due date { .section}

Track all your project's moving parts by giving each deliverable its own due date.

1.  Click **Add Entry** for each deliverable.
2.  Within each new entry, click **Add Custom Field** \> **Date Field**.
3.  Replace the **Date** field titles with Due Date.

## Group by content type { .section}

Create a resources section to collect all of your team's files and bookmarks in one place.

1.  Click **Add Section**, name it Resources, and press Enter.
2.  Within your new section, click **Entry**.

5.  Click **Save**.
