# Subscribing to feeds {#concept_mwb_r5g_hy .concept}

Subscribe to feeds to receive updates about applications and users that matter to you.

## What is a feed? { .section}

Feeds pull information from websites and provide content summaries and links. Your feed reader automatically checks for and retrieves content updates, so you don't have to.

**Note:** You must have a feed reader that supports Atom feeds.

## Subscribe to a feed { .section}

1.  Go to the page with the content that you want to monitor.
2.  Click the **Feed** icon ![Feed icon](subscribe_to_feed.gif)![Feed icon](subscribe_to_feed.jpg) to subscribe to the content on the current page.

    **Note:** In the Blogs app, hover the cursor on the feed link to select whether to add the feed in a community or in the web browser.

3.  Add the feed to your feed reader. For more information, see the documentation for your web browser or feed reader.

**Tips:** \(Communities only\)

-   The Feeds feature in the Communities app works differently. It acts as a mini feed reader that publishes updates from external sites on the community page.
-   When you specify the web address of a feed, you can use the **ps** parameter to specify a different page size for the feed. By default, feeds in Communities display 10 entries per page. The first page of 10 entries is fetched by default. You can use the **page** parameter to fetch subsequent pages. For example, you can use the following web address to fetch the second page of the My Communities feed where the page size is set to 20 entries: ```http://connections.example.com/communities/service/atom/communities/my?page=2&ps=20```.
-   To track activities in the community, subscribe to the Activities feed of that community.
