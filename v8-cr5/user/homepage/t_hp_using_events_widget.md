# Using the Events app {#t_hp_using_events_widget .task}

Use the Events app to keep track of upcoming community events from your home page. The app displays in the activity stream views by default.

The Events app lists the community events that you are following and the events that you are planning to attend. You can access details about the events directly from the app.

-   You can work with the Events app in the following ways:
-   Click an event title to view more details about the event in the Communities app.

    From the Calendar page, you can see which community the event is associated with and access more options for working with the event.

-   Click **Add to Personal Calendar** to add a feed from the app to your personal calendar.

    **Note:** Your email application must support iCal or iCalendar feeds for this functionality to be available.
