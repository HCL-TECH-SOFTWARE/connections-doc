# Home page {#hframe .reference .welcomePage}

Use the home page as a command center to scan and manage items that need your attention. You can view updates for projects and people you work with, discover what's trending in your organization at large, and review your action items all from one place.

With the tabbed views on your home page, you can choose what kinds of updates you want to see, or switch between them. The more people and communities you connect with or follow, the more updates you'll see.

The views are **Top Updates** \(visible if your organization deploys Component Pack for Connections\), **Latest Updates**, **Discover**, and **My Page**.
