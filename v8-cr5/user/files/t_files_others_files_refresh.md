# Working with files {#whatcanidowithotherpeoplesfiles .concept}

Depending on the access level you have to files, you can view, like or recommend, or edit them.

## File permissions { .section}

There are three primary levels of access for any file: private, shared with specific people or communities with either Reader or Editor access, and public. To see what access you and others have for a file, click on the file to open the file page and click **Sharing**.

File owners can allow other people to share files. When someone shares a file with you, they can give you Reader or Editor access. When a file is given public access, anyone can read and download it, even people who are not logged in. After they log in, people can also share the file, add it to a folder, comment on it, and receive notifications when someone edits it or comments on it.
