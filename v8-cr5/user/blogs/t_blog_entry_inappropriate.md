# Flagging an entry as inappropriate {#concept_jr5_q33_my .concept}

See something you consider inappropriate? Flag the entry so that a reviewer can determine whether to remove it from the blog. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Blogs** then select a blog.
2.  Click the entry that you want to flag, then **More Actions** and select **Flag as Inappropriate**.
3.  Categorize the issue if possible. Your administrator can set up a list that reflects concerns in your organization, so it might include categories such as Inappropriate business content or Security risk.
