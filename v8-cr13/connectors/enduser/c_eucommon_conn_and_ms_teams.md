# Using Connections and Microsoft Teams together 

Post links to HCL Connections content in a Microsoft Teams channel, add an app from any of your Connections communities as a tab in a Teams channel, or start a Teams chat from Connections.  

**Note:** These features are available to you only if your organization has customized the environment \(for actions within Connections\) and deployed services for Microsoft Teams \(for actions within Teams\).

Whether you're in Connections or Teams, it's easy to share links to Connections files and other content as posts in your channels.

-   **Share a link to Connections content**
    1.  From the Connections page that you want to share, click on the **Share** button and choose **Share to Microsoft Teams**

    3.  Do one of the following actions:
        -   In **Recent History**, type to filter your recently visited Connections content and select the content that you want to share a link to.
        -   In **Files**, from your files select the content that you want to share a link to.
    4.  Click **Post to Teams**.
    **Note:** Posting links to Connections content from Teams is available only in a team channel, as Microsoft restricts messenger extensions from sharing content in direct chats.


## Add an application from Connections Community as a Teams tab

In organizations that have deployed services for Microsoft Teams, you can add any of the following community apps as a channel tab: Files, Wikis, Blogs, Forums, Recent Updates, Activities, or Highlights.

!!! Note

    -   Team Channel members must also be members of the Community in order to see the content in a Connections App tab.
    -   If you are adding the Activities app from a community to a Teams channel, the option to start a new activity will not be available. However, you can still edit and view activities to which you have access.

1.  In Teams, click **Teams** in the navigation, and then click the channel to which you want to add an app from a Connections community that you belong to.

2.  Click **Add a tab**

4.  Find and select your Connections community, and then select an app from the list \(you can add only one app per Teams tab\). By default, the new tab's name will be in the format "Community name - App name" unless it has been modified.

5.  To add another app as a tab in the channel, repeat steps 2 to 4.

6.  Click **Save**.
