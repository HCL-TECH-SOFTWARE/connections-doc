# Administering the Home page using the wsadmin client {#c_admin_homepage_wsadmin .concept}

Although most of the Home page administration tasks are performed using the Home page user interface, there are some administrative functions that you must perform using the wsadmin client.

For example, you can use wsadmin commands to access the configuration files for the Getting Started wizard and force the Getting Started view to be the default view for Home page users.
