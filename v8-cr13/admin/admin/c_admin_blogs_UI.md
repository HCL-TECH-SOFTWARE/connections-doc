# Administering Blogs from the user interface {#c_admin_blogs_UI .concept}

Make site-wide changes on your Blogs server from the Blogs user interface.

As the Blogs administrator, you can make site-wide changes to the blogs for your organization directly from the Blogs user interface. To do so you must browse to the Blog site using a URL similar to: http://BlogServerName/blogs. Once the site opens, login as an Administrative user. After login, click the **Administration** tab. This page allows you to make site-wide configuration changes.

From this location you can:

-   Specify settings for the Blogs home page
-   Specify settings for what blog creators can do – for example, whether they can apply custom themes or specify trackback links
-   Administer users.
-   Manage the cache

The following additional topics provide information about administering Blogs from the user interface:

-   **[Configuring an administrator for Blogs](../admin/t_create_admin_blogs.md)**  
By default, no user is set to administer Blogs. If you have not already done so, use this procedure to designate a Blogs administrator.
-   **[Managing the Blogs Homepage blog](../admin/c_admin_blogs_homepage_blog.md)**  
The Blogs Homepage blog serves as the main page for your Blogs deployment and has some special considerations.
-   **[Specifying site-wide setting for Blogs](../admin/t_admin_settings_UI.md)**  
Specify site-wide setting for all blogs in your organization.
-   **[Managing a community blog](../admin/t_admin_blogs_manage_com_blog.md)**  
After you add a blog to a community, you can manage the blog from either the community or from the My Blogs page of the Blogs application. However, you can only manage membership from the community.
-   **[Administering Blogs users](../admin/t_admin_blogs_users.md)**  
As the site administrator, you can directly manage a user's blog.
