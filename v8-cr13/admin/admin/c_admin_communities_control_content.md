# Managing community content {#c_admin_communities_control_content .concept}

You can enable the active content filter to prevent users from embedding malicious content in text input fields. You can also use administrative commands to update or remove inappropriate information in fields to which you do not have owner access.

You can also configure a Global Administrator. The Global Administrator has administrative privileges on Communities and all Connections applications. The Global Administrator can use a browser to access any Community and can remove or edit inappropriate content. For more information about Global Administrators, see *Administering application content* and *Administering community content*.
