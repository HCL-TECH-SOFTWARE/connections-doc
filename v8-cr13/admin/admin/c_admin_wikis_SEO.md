# Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) for Wikis {#search_engine_optimization_wikis .concept}

Manage Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) so that your public wiki content is available from internet search engines and achieves a higher ranking in searches.

Your public wikis are already optimized for search engines. By default, HCL Connections generates a sitemap of your public wiki pages that you can submit to search engines.

!!! tip 
    
    To improve the process of search engine optimization, use HTTP compression for your site. HTTP compression decreases the time that is required to download a webpage to a browser. Most webservers, including IBM® HTTP Server, use compression by default but you can check that it is enabled by asking your administrator.

The following topics explain how to submit the sitemap and configure your SEO settings:

-   **[Submitting a sitemap for SEO](../admin/t_admin_wikis_submit_sitemap_SEO.md)**

-   **[Securing SEO](../admin/t_admin_wikis_secure_SEO.md)**
