# Backing up and restoring data {#c_admin_act_manage_backups .concept}

You must back up both the application databases and content stores on a regular schedule using the methods documented by the vendor from whom you purchased the database and file system you are using.

!!! note 
    
    When you restore data for an application that is also available from the Communities application, you must also restore the data in the Communities application to keep the two in sync. See *Recovering from a database failure* for more details.
