# Enabling community feeds {#c_admin_communities_enabling_feeds .concept}

The HCL Connections AJAX proxy is configured to allow cookies, headers or mime types, and all HTTP actions to be exchanged among the HCL Connections applications. However, access to arbitrary URLs is prevented by default.

To enable your users to add feeds with external URLs to communities, you need to update the AJAX proxy configuration file by following the procedure outlined in the topic, *Configuring the AJAX proxy*.

For detailed information about how to enable feeds in communities, see step [4](../secure/t_admin_config_ajax_proxy.md#add_before_default).
