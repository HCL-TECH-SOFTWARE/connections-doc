# Managing the Blogs Homepage blog {#c_admin_blogs_homepage_blog .concept}

The Blogs Homepage blog serves as the main page for your Blogs deployment and has some special considerations.

When you deploy Blogs, a Blogs Homepage blog is created to serve as the entry point for the blogs site. This type of blog is only available to an administrator. You can edit settings for this blog, such as the name or how many entries to display, on the **Configuration** tab of the **Administration** page.
