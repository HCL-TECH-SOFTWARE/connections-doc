# Organizing, syncing, and editing files in My Drive {#concept_hdh_55r_sy .concept}

Use My Drive to organize all of your important folders and files, whether you created them or whether they were shared with you. If your organization has enabled the sync feature, files you add and edit in My Drive are automatically synchronized so you always have the latest version of the content.

!!! important 
    
    To use the following features, your organization must support sync and you must download the Connections Desktop plug-in. See the articles for the [Desktop Plug-in for Windows](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0073986) and [Desktop Plug-in for Mac](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0074308) on the HCL Support site. To access the download links, you must log into the [My HCLSoftware](https://my.hcltechsw.com/).

## Organizing files and folders {#section_aqy_gfk_qtb .section}

Installing the Desktop plug-in creates a My Drive folder that you can access from Windows Explorer or from your Mac OS. You can add content to My Drive from your local desktop, or from the Files app. Just drag or paste files and folders into My Drive to create your own collection. For example, you can create a project file that includes files you created as well as files that were shared with you. From My Drive you can share content just as you would from your My Files list.

Files can be added to more than one location in My Drive. For example, you can add a single file to My Drive and then later add a folder containing the same file. That does not affect the file, but if you later want to remove it entirely from My Drive, you must remove it from both locations.

## Staying in sync {#section_xvf_hgk_qtb .section}

Syncing is a way to automatically replicate changes to your content, whether you created it or it was shared with you, even when multiple people are acting on the content. The content stays in sync so you can see the latest version and you can access it from HCL Connections™ or locally. You can share the file from either place too.

You might occasionally be alerted if there is an issue with syncing. For example, sync might fail if you don’t have permission to move a file or if you update a locked file. The warning will give you information for resolving the issue. You can also click the Connections icon in your toolbar ![Connections icon](images/MyDriveicon.PNG) to open the sync monitor to view and resolve sync issues.

## Editing a file in My Drive {#section_kqs_43k_qtb .section}

To edit a file that is in My Drive, open it from anywhere, edit the content, and save the changes. That’s it!

!!! note
    
    If you were already using the Desktop plug-in before Connections Release 6, the name of the folder will remain <server-name\> sync, or whatever you renamed it, instead of My Drive. Content will still be synced between the desktop sync folder and My Drive in the Files app.
