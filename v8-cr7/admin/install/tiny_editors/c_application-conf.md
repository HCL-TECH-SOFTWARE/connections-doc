# Tiny Editor Services configuration {#tiny-editors .concept}

The Tiny Editor Services use a configuration file called application.conf, written in [Human-Optimized Config Object Notation](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md). These settings can be [overridden by JVM environment variables](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#conventional-override-by-system-properties) named with the [path of the setting](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#paths-as-keys).

The configuration file is used to adjust settings, including:

Enabled services
:   The link-checking and media-embed services can be independently turned on or off.

Allowed origins
:   URLs for the domains loading the Tiny Editors which require access to the Tiny Editor Services \(such as `https://www.example.com`\). This is needed to allow a browser security feature called CORS to work correctly.

Proxy settings
:   The services can be configured to communicate with servers outside their network through a proxy server.

Security settings
:   The services can be configured to use custom settings for validating certificates, or for the purpose of testing the certificate validation, can be switched off.

Rules for embedding links
:   Endpoints can be specified for converting links using the OEmbed standard.

For a list of available settings, see: [List of valid application.conf settings](r_application-conf.md).
