# Installing or upgrading Component Pack for Connections {#cp_install_config_intro .concept}

Component Pack is now deployed through Harbor, an open-source container and Helm registry hosted by HCL for the Component Pack build. It simplifies deployment compared to the approach in previous releases, which involves using a zip file and a local Docker registry.

When you install or upgrade Component Pack, you will need to add the HCL Harbor repository to your Helm CLI so that you can pull container images and Helm charts for your deployment directly from Harbor. For more information on the steps you need to perform for installation or upgrade, see [Installation and upgrade](../install/cp_install_upgrade_container.md).
    
Customers with credentials to access Connections in the HCL Software License & Download portal may apply those credentials to access Harbor.
