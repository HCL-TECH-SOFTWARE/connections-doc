# Granting access to OpenSearch Metrics for communities {#cp_config_es_grant_access_community .task}

Configure the `community-metrics-run` security role to grant users the authority to view community metrics using static reports.

Only users assigned to the `community-metrics-run` role can access community metrics of the communities they own. You can map this role to everyone, or to subset of the user population. For example, you can gradually provide the community metrics feature to the user population by mapping this role to small group first, and then adding more users to the role over time.

**Note:** By default, the `community-metrics-run` role is already assigned to `All Authenticated in Application's Realm` for both the MetricsUI and Communities applications, which means that all the community owners have the authority to run the community metrics of his or her community. Therefore, if you want to assign the access only to the specific users or groups, remove the `All Authenticated in Application's Realm` from the MetricsUI and Communities applications first.
