# Reviewing the Seedlists Validation tab {#r_review_seedlist_validation_tab .reference}

The Seedlists Validation tab validates that the application seedlists can be accessed for search engine crawling.

## Checking that the application seedlists are available { .section}

Inaccessible seedlists mean that content that is not searchable from the service. A request is sent to each application to verify that the seedlist is accessible. Accessible seedlists are highlighted in a green text box. If there is a problem with the service, and no seedlist is accessible this is highlighted in a red text box. Use your browser to view the page for the inaccessible seedlist. For more information, see [Validating seedlists using the browser](t_admin_search_check_seedlist.md). Accessing seedlists through a browser can also help you detect authentication issues. Also, review the log file for the affected service to identify and fix any exceptions.
