# Customizing notifications {#c_customize_notifications .concept}

The content of the notifications sent by HCL Connectionsâ„¢ is defined in templates that are processed by the FreeMarker engine.

You can customize notifications by modifying the existing template files or by replacing the files with custom templates that you create yourself. You can also edit the text strings and images used in the notifications.

**Important:**

-   Starting from Connections 6.0 CR4, a new template version is provided and you can enable it by editing configuration. Go to [Enabling the new notification templates](../admin/t_admin_common_enable_template.md) for details.
-   Before making any customizations, first back up your original notifications folder. In addition, ensure that any customized files are backed up before performing a product upgrade or applying a cumulative refresh or fix pack, as you might need to merge your changes again manually after making updates.
