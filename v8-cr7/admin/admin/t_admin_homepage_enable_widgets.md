# Enabling widgets {#t_admin_homepage_enable_widgets .task}

You need to enable widgets before they can display on the Home page or elsewhere in HCL Connections.

The Home page administration user interface lists the current status of widgets in the widgets catalog, and allows you to enable and disable widgets as needed. All changes made in the user interface, including enabling and disabling widgets, take immediate effect without the need for application restart.

1.  To change a widget's status to enabled, complete the following steps.
2.  Open the Administration view.

3.  In the **Disabled apps** area, select the widget that you want to enable and click **Enable**.
