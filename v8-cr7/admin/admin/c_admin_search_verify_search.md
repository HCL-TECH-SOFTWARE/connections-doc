# Verifying Search {#c_admin_search_verify_search .concept}

You can perform a number of steps to verify that Search index creation has completed successfully and the Search application is working as expected.

When you install HCL Connections, Search indexing is automatically configured to run according to a default schedule. You can confirm that the initial index creation has completed successfully by checking for the presence of specific files in the index directory. You can also verify that Search is crawling on a regular basis and that incremental indexing is taking place as expected by checking for specific log messages in the SystemOut.log file.
