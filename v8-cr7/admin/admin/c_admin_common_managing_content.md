# Managing content {#managingcontent .concept}

Use superusers, moderation, and other methods to manage HCL Connections content.

-   **[Administering application content](../admin/r_admin_common_superusers.md)**  
To view and control content in your deployment, you can create a dedicated global administrator or administrators with administrative capabilities over content in the applications.
-   **[Administering community content](../admin/t_admin_communities_create_superuser.md)**  
You can create a dedicated administrator with access to all communities, public, or restricted. This administrator has granular control over communities content, including the ability to edit or remove inappropriate content. This administrator is also required for HCL SametimeÂ® integration with HCL Connections.
-   **[Administering Moderation](../install/c_config_moderation_app.md)**  
Configure and administer moderation so that moderators can review content for blogs, forums, and community files from a central interface.
