Need to expand your network? Use the Who Connects Us app to view your connections and see how others are connected to you.

## Using the Who Connects Us app {#section_hff_ljt_2y .section}

Use the Who Connects Us in the following ways:

-   To view someone's business card, hover over their name.
-   To send the person an email, click their email directly from the business card.
-   To view the person's profile, communities that they belong to, and their content on other apps, click the **More Actions** icon ![](more_actions.png) from the business card, and select which information you'd like to see.

## How the Who Connects Us app works { .section}

To determine whether someone appears in this app, a formula is used to evaluate relationships and pick the users. The following factors are evaluated:

-   Number of tags in common
-   Number of dialog-related tags in common
-   Number of people in common
-   Number of people using the same dialog-related tags
-   Number and type of content both users are in, for example, whether you share content in communities, blogs, and so on
