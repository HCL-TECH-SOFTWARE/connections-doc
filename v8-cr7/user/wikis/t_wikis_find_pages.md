# How do I find wiki pages? {#howdoifindpages .concept}

There are several ways to find pages in a wiki. When a wiki page is renamed, the URL changes but you can still open the page by clicking on a page with the original name.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Wikis** and select the wiki you want to search in.
2.  Complete any of the following actions:

    - To find a page in the page hierarchy: Click the arrow next to the page name to expand the pages in the sidebar.
    - To find a page by using a tag: In the Tags area, click a tag in the tag cloud or list.
    - To search for pages: [Perform a search](../eucommon/t_eucommon_searching_lc.md) to look for the wiki page by name, and [filter your search results](../eucommon/t_eucommon_view_search_results.md) to quickly find the page.
    - To find pages by title:
      1. Click **Index** and expand the **Pages** section.
      2. Click **Go to Page**, and then enter keywords that are found in the wiki page.
    
    - To find pages that you edited:
      1. Click **Index** and expand the **Pages** section.
      2. Click **I Edited**.

    - To find pages that a wiki member edited:
      1. Click **Index** and expand the **Pages** section.
      2. Click **Edited by**. Enter a name or email address, and then select that name or email address.

    - To find pages by date created:
      1. Click **Index** and expand the **Date** section.
      2. Click a time period to show pages that were created or updated during that period, for example the **Last 30 days**.


## Finding a page that is renamed { .section}

When you change the name of a wiki page, the URL is changed. But when someone clicks on a link with the original name, they are redirected to the new URL. If there are two or more pages that carried the original URL, and you click on the original URL of a renamed page, then two \(or more\) pages will be displayed.

You can open the page or pages with the original name or the new one.
