# Unsubscribing from community emails {#t_com_unsubscribe_from_community_emails .task}

If you prefer not to get community-wide emails from owners and other members of a community that you belong to, you can unsubscribe from the emails without having to unfollow or leave the community.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to unsubscribe from.

2.  Click **Community Actions** and select **Unsubscribe from Mail**.

    **Note:** If you change your mind, you can always return to the community, click **Community Actions** and select **Subscribe to Mail** from the list.


You will no longer get general emails from the community. If you want to manage email notifications that you're getting as a result of choosing to follow people or communities, see [Getting browser and email notifications](../profiles/c_pers_getting_notifications.md).
