# Communities {#cframe .reference .welcomePage}

Get together with people who share your interests.

## Working with communities as an external user { .section .welcomePage}

If you are an external user you can collaborate fully as a member in the communities that you are a part of. That is, you have access to all the community features \(such as community wikis\) that other members have access to. However, you cannot own or create a community. For more information about what external users can do, see [Connecting with external users](../eucommon/c_eucommon_ext_user.md).

## Getting started { .section .welcomePage}

-   [Join a community](c_com_join.md) and start contributing.
-   [Participate in your community's forum](t_com_forum_topic_add.md) and get a discussion going.
-   [Share files](c_com_share_file.md) with your community.
-   [Create your own community](t_com_create.md) and bring a group of like-minded people together.

## Using your community {#section_fyx_ytx_l5b .section}

For community members, the following topics can help you participate effectively in your community:

-   [Finding out what's going on](whatsgoingon.md) - View the members in a community, keep up or opt out of updates, and share related communities.
-   [Communicating with community members](sharing_your_ideas_and_points_of_view.md) - Share your idea in a blog, ideation blog, forum, or wiki.
-   [Enhancing collaboration](enhancing_collaboration.md) - Let information flow freely among members by sharing files, assigning tasks, creating bookmarks, scheduling events, and adding content feeds.

## Managing your community {#section_ts3_r5x_l5b .section}

For community owners, the following topics are useful in ensuring that your community is relevant, useful, and up-to-date:

-   [Adding members to grow your community](c_com_add_members.md) - Manage community membership, for example by adding, inviting, or removing members, and importing and exporting a membership list. Learn what community owners, members, and non-members can do.
-   [Managing your community to keep it relevant](c_com_manage_communities.md) - Organize your community and keep it updated. For example, you can review content submitted for approval or flagged as inappropriate; change your community's access level and roles for each app, like your community blog; and move or delete your community.
-   [Keeping your apps contemporary](apps_frame.md) - Add apps to your community and to the Highlights page, and manage those apps accordingly. Learn how to manage a community blog or ideation blog, forums, activities, files, rich content, and galleries. You can also get insight into how people use your community with metrics.

-   **[Getting started](../communities/community_getstart.md)**
