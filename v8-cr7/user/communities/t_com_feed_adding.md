# Adding a feed to a community {#t_com_feed_adding .task}

Subscribe to a feed to keep your community informed with up-to-the minute information from a website without leaving the community.

You can only add publicly available feeds to a community. An administrator may make certain feed sources trusted – for example, feeds from other Connections apps – in which case the authenticated feeds from these sources display. However, by default, authenticated feeds are not allowed.

1.  To add a feed to your community:
2.  Find a feed that you want to subscribe to, for example a public wiki page.

3.  Right-click the feed icon and copy the link URL. This image is one type of feed icon ![Feed icon](images/feed.png), but there are many variations.

4.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community you'd like to add the feed to. Then, click **Feeds** in the community menu.

5.  Click **Add Feed** and fill the form. In the Feed field, paste the web address of the feed.

6.  Click **Save**.


If you get a 403 error when you try to access the feed, this might be because your administrator has configured your deployment to prevent access to URLs outside this product. Contact the administrator for more information.
