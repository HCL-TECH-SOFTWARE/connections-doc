## Supported image files {#section_tfs_2ts_sy .section}

You can add any image file format that is supported by your browser. The most widely supported image formats are BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, and RAW

**Note:** This function differs across applications. In Blog, Forums, and Wiki, you can upload an image from your computer, insert an image from the web, and paste an image. In Blog and Wiki, you can also use an existing image that you already uploaded.

## Inserting an image {#section_unp_4ts_sy .section}

1.  Create or edit a blog entry, a wiki page, or a forum topic.
2.  In the **Entry** field, place the cursor where you want the image to be displayed.
3.  Click the **Insert Image** icon in the editor toolbar.
4.  Click the tab to select whether you want to upload an image from **Local Files**, **Web URL**, or **Existing Images**.
    -   In **Local Files** tab, click **Browse** to select the image from your computer. You can directly drag and drop files to the window. Set the additional options and then click **Upload Image**.

        **Note:** In Blog and Wiki, you can only upload one image at a time, but in Forums, you can upload more than one image at a time.

    -   In **Web URL** tab, enter the URL where the image file is located. If the image is on an external server, use the full address, for example, http://example.com/image.png. If the image is on the same server as the Connections application, use a relative path, for example, /images/image.png. Then click **Insert Image**.
    -   In **Existing Images** tab, select the image that you want to insert from existing images and then click **Insert Image**.

        **Note:** Only Blog and Wiki support selecting from existing images. For blogs, images added in all entries of the same blog are available for you to select. For wikis, you can only select from the images that are already inserted in the same wiki page.

5.  After the image is inserted, you can set image properties by right-clicking the image and select **Image Properties**.

    - **Alternative text**: Add descriptive text about the image to make it accessible to visually impaired users.
    - **Width**: Width of the image in pixels.
    - **Height**: Height of the image in pixels.
    - **Horizontal space**: Horizontal margin, in pixels, between the image and adjacent objects.
    - **Vertical space**: Vertical margin, in pixels, between the image and adjacent objects.
    - **Align** : The alignment of the image. For example: Left-aligned or right-aligned.
    - **Border**: Size of the border around the image in pixels.
    - **Preview**: A view of the image that uses the attributes that you selected.

6.  Click the **Link** tab to assign a link to the inserted image:

    - **URL**: The web address that the image points to. If the image is on an external server, use the full address, for example, http://example.com/page1.html, but not www.example.com/page1.html. If the image is on the same server as the Connections application, use a relative path, for example, /page1.html.

    - **Target**: Specify whether the link opens in a new window, the topmost window, the same window, or the parent window. For more information, go to the [HTML <a\> target Attribute](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp) webpage.
