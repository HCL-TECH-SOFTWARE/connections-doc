# The Connections community app for Microsoft Sharepoint {#concept_xxl_4bt_qnb .concept}

As a Microsoft SharePoint administrator you can register the Sharepoint app with Microsoft Azure and edit its configuration file in HCL Connections to make it available for your organization.

**Note:** The SharePoint app is installed with the rest of Connections during installation.

Once the administration tasks are complete, Community owners can choose to add the app to their community for members to be able to view, edit, and share documents from a SharePoint server. For the user help, see [Adding the SharePoint app to a community](../../user/communities/t_com_add_sharepoint_widget.md).

For the administrator help, see the following topics:

-   **[Configuring the Sharepoint app in Microsoft Azure AD](../../connectors/admin/t_admin_sharepoint_app_enabling.md)**  
Register and configure the HCL Connections community app for Microsoft Sharepoint in the Azure Active Directory.
-   **[Configuring the Sharepoint app in Connections](../../connectors/admin/t_admin_sharepoint_app_configure.md)**  
Edit the widgets-config.xml file for Communities to update the SharePoint Library app definition and provide the app's client ID and the URL for the Microsoft Office 365 tenant that the app will connect to.
