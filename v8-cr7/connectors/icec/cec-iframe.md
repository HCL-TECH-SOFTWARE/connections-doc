## Content source { .section}

Source is the website you enter in the URL input field. The information of the site will be transferred directly to the Connections Engagement Center.

## Expected format { .section}

The source of the IFrame widget should be able to be shown in an IFrame. The screenshot of the IFrame widgets shows the web view of an IBM Notes application. There is only some information about a menu. If you try to display a whole website you will see that there is not enough space to show it complete.
