# Admin dashboard {#Admindashboard .reference}

The Admin Dashboard is reachable through the URL: \[your\_domain\]/xcc/admin apps.\[yourLocale\].collabserv.com/xcc/admin. You will find system configurations there, so be careful with that. For example, North American users would use apps.na.collabserv.com/xcc/admin

The following options can be found in the Admin Dashboard:

-   Enable/Disable Backup
-   Set Connections Context-Roots
-   Set Customization folder
-   Set Connections Theme
-   Set Anonymous Access

## Admin Caching { .section}

Each **User all** request from the Connections Engagement Center is cached for 15 minutes if Admin caching is enabled. Caching increases performance. However, sometimes this will result in confusion. For example, if the editor publishes a new blog entry and it is not shown directly on the Connections Engagement Center pages. Disable **Caching for Admins** to see new blog entries immediately. You will find this setting in the Admin Dashboard in the Global Settings tab.

-   **[Open Community Links in new Tab](../../connectors/icec/cec-open-comm-links-in-new-tab.md)**  
Select **Open Community-Links in new Tab** to open news links in a new tab. This functionality only works for links in news widgets such as **Top News**, **News**, and **News Slider** which aggregate blog posts from different Communities \(only if you aggregate blogs from different Communities will the link be shown\).
-   **[Debugging](../../connectors/icec/onprem-cec-inst-debugging.md)**  
Debug any page by first enabling debugging and then appending a parameter to any Connections Engagement Center URL.
-   **[Handling external images](../../connectors/icec/cec-handling-external-images.md)**  
Use the Admin Dashboard to control how HTTP images pulled from the web can be displayed in Connections Engagement Center.
