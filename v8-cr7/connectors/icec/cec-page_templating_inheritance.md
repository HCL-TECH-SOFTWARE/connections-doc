# Templating and inheritance {#id_name .reference}

You can mark an Connections Engagement Center page as template and use it to inherit from. If you are on an Connections Engagement Center page itself, open the admin panel, click on the **Page Settings** tab, then click on the **Show Advanced** button and you will see the advanced section. In this section you find a checkbox named **Is Template**. Check this box then click the save button on the bottom right and you will have this page as an Connections Engagement Center template.

You can do this in **Page Management** as well. Go to the Page Management and click on the wrench icon of the page to edit it. In the new opened modal window you can edit the page and on the bottom left you can find the checkbox **Is Template** as well.
