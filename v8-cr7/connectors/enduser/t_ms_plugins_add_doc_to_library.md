# Working with Office documents in a library {#t_ms_plugins_add_doc_to_library .task}

Libraries enable Community members to upload, manage, organize and collaborate on files shared on the FileNet Document Management system. A community can contain multiple Libraries.

**Note:** Interaction with libraries from Microsoft Office is only available when you are connecting to a HCL Connections server. This feature is not supported on Connections Cloud.

When the HCL Connections Content Manager add-on is deployed on a Connections server, community owners can create community libraries directly in Office. Community libraries provide owners and members with the content management capabilities and enhanced social features.

-   Navigate to a Library in the HCL Connections namespace extension and Open a Microsoft Office document. Then, click **IBM Connections** on the Office ribbon. Choose from one of the following **File Actions** options:

    |Action|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |Check out|Members can check out files and edit them using private drafts. Checked out files are locked to prevent other users from making updates at the same time. Making changes to a library file creates a new local draft. You are notified about the draft in the Library Drafts Monitor.|
    |Check in|After you are done editing a file, choose **Check in**. Your changes are uploaded to the server and the file is unlocked so that others can edit it.|
    |Upload draft|Choose **Upload draft** to upload the updated file and update the draft on the server.|
    |Share|Choose **Share** to change default sharing settings on this file.|
    |Comments|To provide feedback on the file, click **Comments** to open the file in a browser so that you can add a comment.|
    |Open in Browser|Click **Open in browser** to view the file in Connections. You then have full access to all of the supported features for working with library files.|
    |Properties|Click **Properties** to view and edit properties for the document.|
    |Links|Copy or send a link to the browser version of the document.     -   **Send URL** generates an email with a link to this document.
    -   **Copy URL** copies the URL to the clipboard so you can paste it into a message or document.
