# Adding a file to a library {#t_files_windows_ccm_add_file .task}

Add a file from Windows Explorer or your desktop to a library.

Upload a file to the library as a file that others can see or as a personal draft.

1.  Use one of these methods to add a file to a library:

    -   Drag and drop a file from your desktop or from Windows Explorer to the library folder.
    -   Cut or copy a file from your desktop or from Windows Explorer and paste it in the library folder.
    -   Open a document in an Office application, choose Add to Community from the HCL Connections section on the ribbon and choose a community library or folder.
2.  Accept the defaults or set any of the following options for adding the file to the library:

    -   Edit the file name and description.
    -   In the **Document type** section, click **Change** to change the document type.

        **Note:** The default document type is set by the community owner in the community library settings. The selection of document types is specified on the Enterprise Content Management \(ECM\) server.

    -   Select **Show only required fields** to display only required fields in the document type section.
    -   Edit the available properties as needed. Required fields are marked with an asterisk. For example, \*Sales Date.
    -   Choose **Check In** to upload the file and make it available to library users, or **Add as Draft** to save as a draft that only you can view.

        **Note:** If review workflow is enabled for the library, instead of **Check In**, the menu option will be **Submit for Review**. Once you submit a file, a reviewer must approve it before it is available to others. If you need to change the file, you must access it through the browser interface.
