## Content source { .section}

When editing the widget, you will be asked to add an **Activityname**. By adding a name, an entry will be added in the IBM Activity application under **Notes App:Activityname**. This functions as the content source for the respective widget and enables the user to implement different personal to do?s/notes in multiple MyNotes widgets.
