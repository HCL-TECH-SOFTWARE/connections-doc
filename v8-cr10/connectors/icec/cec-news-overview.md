## Content source { .section}

A Connections community or standalone blog is defined as content source for this widget. The source has to contain at least one blog entry.

## Expected format { .section}

The entries are shown with date, headline, picture or video and abstract. Pictures and videos will be shown with a height of 100 pixels. If your blog entry has no picture and no image, the community image will be shown. In the lower right corner there is a **more news** link to the original blog.

With a click on an entry an Embedded Experience Pop Up opens on the right side next to the widget. The pop-up contains the complete content of the blog entry, including all comments and likes. Within the Embedded Experience the article can be liked/unliked and commented. It also contains an **Open in Community** link underneath the article that forwards to the actual blog entry.

You can get the community title as the widget title by entering **%sourceName%** into the widget title.

You can aggregate blog entries from different Communities. If you aggregate them, the News will also have a link to this community in the headline. You can remove the link in the Admin Dashboard. After that only the name of the community will be shown.
