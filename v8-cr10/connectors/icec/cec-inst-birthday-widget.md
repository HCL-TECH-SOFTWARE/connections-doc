# People Birthday widget {#id_name .reference}

For the people birthday widget it is necessary to modify your HCL Connections Profiles configuration.

The People Birthday widget searches for all profiles, which have a profile extension field \[name = birthday\] and value with the actual date. In date format \* -MM-DD e.g. \*-10-16 for the 16th October. Instead of the asterisk you can enter for example YYYY, if you do not save this information you can change the input to -MM-DD.
