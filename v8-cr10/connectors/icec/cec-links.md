## Content source { .section}

For each channel a Connections Community is configured as content source in this widget. Each of those Communities have to contain at least one bookmark.

## Expected format { .section}

For each selected Community one tab with the correlating bookmarks will be shown. The bookmarks are sorted alphabetically. With a click on the bookmark, the user will be forwarded to the corresponding URL.

Since Version 5.0 you can also select files from the community and display them in the order you want to have. Since Version 9.0 you can sort them by name or update date.

Also you can have a search in the widget, to search for a specific file. This is helpful, if you are showing lots of files with or without paging.

You can get the Community title as channel name by entering **%sourceName%** into the channel name field.
