# Creating a link to a file {#t_files_windows_share_link .task}

Create a link to a file to share it with others.

You can create a link to a file in two ways. You can manually copy a link so that you can insert the link in a document, message, or email. Or, you can choose an option that automatically generates an email containing the link. A URL link is a standard link to the file.

1.  Right-click a file and choose **Links**.

2.  Choose a type of link:

    -   **Send URL** generates an email with a link to this file.
    -   **Copy URL** copies the URL to the clipboard so you can paste it into a message or document.
