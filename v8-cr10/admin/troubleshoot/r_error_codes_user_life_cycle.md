|CLFWY0210E: The new and old external identifier arguments cannot have the same value.|This error is encountered if you enter incorrect wsadmin command input.|Enter the correct wsadmin command data.|
|CLFWY0211E: The user specified by old external id "\{0\}" is already active. No action was taken.|This error is encountered if you enter incorrect wsadmin command input.|Enter the correct wsadmin command data.|

|CLFWY0243E: There is no member associated with the e-mail address \{0\}. Continuing to process addresses in the list.|This error is encountered if one of the emails or login names in the list provided did not resolve to a member.|Correct the email or login name in the text file.|

|CLFWY0245E: The member associated with the new external id is inactive.|This error is encountered if you enter incorrect wsadmin command input.|Enter the correct wsadmin command data.|
|CLFWY0255I: The synchronize command deactivated member \{0\} \[Ext id: \{1\}\]| | |
|CLFWY0256I: The synchronize command found an ambiguous login/email name \{1\} for the member with display name \{2\}. For this member two or more login names resolve to different profiles in the directory.

It probably means that there is an error in the LDAP directory.|Check the LDAP directory and fix any errors.|

|CLFWY0258I: The inactivated count is \{0\}|Informational message only.|No response required except to read the message to learn what action the command performed.|
|CLFWY0259I: Ending synchronization by login or email|Informational message only.|No response required except to read the message to learn what action the command performed.|

|CLFWY0263I: The synchronize command found that active member \{0\} \[current external id: \{1\}, application id \{2\}\] could not be matched via external id, but could be matched via login or email to external id \{3\}.
