# Administering application content {#creatingibmconnectionssuperusers .reference}

To view and control content in your deployment, you can create a dedicated global administrator or administrators with administrative capabilities over content in the applications.

## Global administrator capabilities { .section}

A global administrator can edit and remove objectionable content. The Moderation feature can help this process, but not all components implement Moderation. Also, although some wsadmin commands can be helpful with removing objectionable content, they do not cover all situations. For example, when the only Owner of, for example, an activity or community, leaves the organization or is away for an extended time period, the Global Administrator can add more owners and even replace the original owner.
