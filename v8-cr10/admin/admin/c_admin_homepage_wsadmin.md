# Administering the Home page using the wsadmin client {#c_admin_homepage_wsadmin .concept}

Although most of the Home page administration tasks are performed using the Home page user interface, there are some administrative functions that you must perform using the wsadmin client.

For example, you can use wsadmin commands to access the configuration files for the Getting Started wizard and force the Getting Started view to be the default view for Home page users.

-   **[Home page administrative commands](../admin/r_admin_homepage_admin_commands.md)**  
Use the commands listed to administer the Home page application.
-   **[Forcing the Getting Started view to be the default Home page view](../customize/t_customize_getstarted_tab_on.md)**  
Using an administrative command, you can force the Getting Started view to be the default view for all users or a subset of users.
-   **[Managing the default view of the home page](../admin/t_admin_homepage_getstart.md)**  
Edit configuration property settings to allow users to go straight to **ActivityStream** instead of **Getting Started**.
