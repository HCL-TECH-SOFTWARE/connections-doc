Specifies whether to ignore punctuation in search terms.

This property accepts a value of true or false.

When the property is set to true, punctuation in search terms is ignored. For example, for an occurrence of the term I.B.M, the terms I.B.M. and IBM are stored in the index.

**Note:** This configuration results in a larger index. To change this option, complete the steps in the *Deleting the index* topic.

**search.interService.href**
Web address from which other HCL Connections applications access Advanced Search.

Specify the protocol \(HTTP\), server name, and, optionally, the port number.

**Notes:**

-   Provide a fully qualified domain name.
-   This parameter is case-sensitive.

**search.language.sensitivity.enabled**
Specifies whether to enable language sensitivity in searches.

This property accepts a value of true or false.

When the property is set to true, the product supports accent-insensitive searches. For example, for an occurrence of Ã¡lt, the product stores Ã¡lt and alt.

**Note:** This configuration results in a larger index. To change this option, complete the steps in the *Deleting the index* topic.

**search.Queue\_Max**
If the server that hosts the Search application stops responding, a queue of requests is created. The length of the queue is defined by the value of this property. Only the last search request in the queue is sent to the Search server. When the server starts responding, the queue is no longer used. The default value is 10.

This property specifies the number of connections that are refused before a subsequent transaction is allowed.

**Note:** The property is used only when Search is installed on a different server from the server where a search is run.

**search.seedlist.maximumPageSize**
Maximum number of items on the search return page. The value must be greater than or equal to 100.

**search.ssl.enabled**
Specifies whether this application can be accessed over HTTPS.

This property is set to true by default.

**Note:** Disabling SSL is not supported.

**search.ssl.href**
Web address from which to access Advanced Search over HTTPS.

Specify the protocol \(HTTPS\), server name, and, optionally, the port number.

**Notes:**

-   Provide a fully qualified domain name.
-   This parameter is case-sensitive.

**search.Transaction\_Max**
Maximum number of transactions allowed. This setting prevents the server that is running the search from running out of memory because the server is not responding. The default value is 20.

**Note:** The property is used only when Search is installed on a different server from the server where a search is run.

**seedlistSettings.maximumIncrementalQuerySpanInDays**
Number of days that deletion records are preserved before they can be deleted by the SearchClearDeletionHistory task. The value must be greater than or equal to 1.

HCL Connections keeps records of deleted files. These records are eligible to be deleted by the SearchClearDeletionHistory task after the number of days that are specified in this property.

The incremental search crawler needs these deletion records to update the search index. If the records are deleted before the incremental crawler reads them, updates become incomplete. Therefore, HCL Connections performs a full crawl instead of an incremental crawl.

Full crawls delete the existing search index and create a new one, which is more time-consuming than incremental crawls. To avoid frequent full crawls, ensure that this value is higher than the span of days between incremental crawls. For example, if incremental crawls happen every 4 days, ensure that this value is higher than 4 so that incremental crawls capture all deletion records.

**use.richTextEditor.inBookmarklet.enabled**
Specifies whether the description field on the Edit Bookmark form is a rich text or plain text field. The form is displayed when you create a bookmark by clicking **Add Bookmark**. The form loads more quickly with a plain text description field. The field is plain text by default.

This property accepts a value of true or false.

**versionStamp**
Defines a version number as an internal URL reference for static content on the product's webpages. After you customize HCL Connections or install an interim fix, the administrator increments the value of this property. The new value prevents users having to clear their web browser cache to see the latest changes. When you update the value of this property, pass a null value to make the server assign a time stamp value to it. If you choose to specify your own time stamp, use the following syntax: `yyyyMMdd.HHmmss`. For example: `20090720.034448`.

**wikis.ejb.cluster**
Name of the cluster on which the application is running in a network deployment. This property is used for JNDI lookups in cluster environments to ensure failover and load balancing on lookups.

**wikis.ejb.port**
Port number of the application server instance on the first node of the cluster that hosts this application. This information is used during JNDI lookups. This value is usually 2809 but might be different if port 2809 is already in use.

**wikis.ejb.server**
Fully qualified domain name of the application server instance on the first node of the cluster that hosts this application. This information is used during JNDI lookups.

**wikis.enabled**
Specifies whether this application can be accessed over HTTP.

**wikis.href**
Web address from which to access this application over HTTP.

**wikis.href.prefix**
Context root from which to access the application.

For example: /wikis

**wikis.interService.href**
Web address from which other HCL Connections applications access this application.

**wikis.pcs.name.js.eval**
Label of the link from the business card to this application.

**wikis.pcs.url.pattern**
Web pattern of the link from the business card to this application.

**wikis.ssl.href**
Web address from which to access this application over HTTPS.

Specify the protocol \(HTTPS\), server name, and, optionally, the port number.

**Notes:**

-   Provide a fully qualified domain name.
-   This parameter is case-sensitive.

**wikis.ssl.enabled**
Specifies whether this application can be accessed over HTTPS.

This property is set to true by default.

**Note:** Disabling SSL is not supported.
