# Configuring scheduled tasks {#c_admin_search_configure_scheduled_tasks .concept}

The SearchService MBean is used to access a service that provides an administrative interface for adding scheduled task definitions to the Home page database.

To configure scheduled tasks for Search, use the SearchService administration commands to add and delete scheduled task definitions, and or to enable or disable indexing task definitions in the Home page database.

You can also use SearchService commands get a list of the tasks that are scheduled for the Search application, and to list the tasks that are currently running for Search.
