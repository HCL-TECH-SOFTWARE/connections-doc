# Restoring the Search index {#c_admin_search_restore_index .concept}

When you create a backup copy of the Search index, you can use the copy to restore the index in the event of loss or corruption.

The process for restoring the Search index differs depending on the number of nodes in your deployment. In an environment with multiple nodes, you must restore the backup consistently for all the nodes.
