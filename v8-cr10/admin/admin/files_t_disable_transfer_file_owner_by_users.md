# Disabling transfer of file ownership by users {#files_t_disable_transfer_file_owner_by_users .task}

By default, users who own files can transfer a file to a new owner by choosing the **Transfer Ownership** command from their file's preview page or from one of the list views in their Files app. Follow this procedure if you prefer to hide this option from users.

**Note:** The following steps disable the feature only in the user's Files application interface. Administrators and users can still transfer the ownership of files through the API.

1.  Modify LotusConnections-config.xml \(in the DMGR folder\) by editing the following generic property, changing true to false:

    ```
    <genericProperty name="files.ownership.transfer.enabled">false</genericProperty>
    ```

2.  Synchronize the nodes.

    **Note:** If, as the administrator, you want to transfer a user's files in bulk, see the topic [Transferring ownership of user files](t_transfer_ownership_of_user_files.md).
