# Administering Wikis {#administeringwikis .concept}

Configure and administer Wikis by using the wsadmin client to run administrative commands or by editing the configuration file directly.

Use the wsadmin client to run administrative commands to perform tasks that manipulate Wikis content. Changes that you make by using the wsadmin client take effect immediately. Edit the configuration file directly to control how and when various Wikis operations take place. Before changes to the configuration file can take effect, you must synchronize the nodes and restart the application server.
