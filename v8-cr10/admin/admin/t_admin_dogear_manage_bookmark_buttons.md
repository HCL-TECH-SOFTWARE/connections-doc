# Managing multiple Bookmark buttons {#t_admin_dogear_manage_bookmark_buttons .task}

If you are creating bookmarks on more than one server, you may have to rename your Bookmarks browser buttons to avoid conflicts.

The **Add Bookmark** button is a browser add-on that you install from the Bookmarking Tools link in the page footer of the Bookmarks app. When you install an **Add Bookmark** button to your browser toolbar, it is associated with a particular server. If you want to create bookmarks for Bookmarks deployments on more than one server, you must install an **Add Bookmark** button for each server. You may find, however, that if you click ButtonA to create a bookmark on ServerA, then click ButtonB to create a bookmark on ServerB, you will create another bookmark for ServerA instead. If this happens, follow these steps to rename the second **Add Bookmark** button to a unique name.

1.  Right-click the button you want to rename.

2.  Choose properties.

3.  Enter a new name.

4.  Click OK to save the button with the new name.
