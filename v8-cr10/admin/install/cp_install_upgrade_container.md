# Installation and upgrade {#cp_install_upgrade_container .concept}

Experienced customers can download a package to do an automated installation or upgrade of Component Pack for HCL Connections. It is best for new customers to read this introduction and at least initially to do the manual steps in this section to gain a better understanding of Component Pack.

## Ansible deployment automation framework provided by HCL {#section_lly_2sn_tnb .section}

If you are unfamiliar with Kubernetes management and its associated dependencies, or if you wish to gain insights on how to automate the
deployment process, we encourage you to explore our HCL Connections and Component Pack Deployment Automation Framework. This framework provides insights into the automation of deployment workflows and can be used as an accelerator to reduce the overhead of deploying a Connections environment.  It orchestrates the seamless setup of Kubernetes, kubectl, Helm, and performs the necessary tasks to facilitate creation of a deployment of HCL Connections and Component Pack.

For more specifics on how to use the automation, see HCL's open-source GitHub for the documents [Quickstart for setting up HCL Connections and Component Pack Deployment Automation Framework](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/connections-automation/blob/main/documentation/QUICKSTART.md) and [HCL Connections and Component Pack Deployment Automation Framework](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/connections-automation/blob/main/README.md).

## Replacing Component Pack {#section_g34_mfp_tnb .section}

Component Pack runs on top of the Kubernetes, and for important data uses persistent storage. That storage lives, in a supported way, on NFS or Amazon EFS, if you are running stuff on Amazon, so your data should be already safe.

It is possible to simply recreate Kubernetes cluster and reinstall Component Pack and simply continue using it with the data as where you left it before you did it. Removing Component Pack and/or Kubernetes doesn't affect your data at all. Just don't remove the data.

In theory, you can have multiple Kubernetes clusters with multiple installations of Component Pack, and on Connections side, by manipulating httpd.conf in your IHS, you can decide to which one to point to. Just don't try to have multiple clusters using same PVs at the same time for the sake of data consistency and reliability.

## Installation and upgrade general approach {#section_anp_tfp_tnb .section}

You will notice that we are going to use the same commands to install or upgrade Component Pack. For upgrade from Connections 7.0, the baseline we use includes Kubernetes-based components, like Elasticsearch 7-based Metrics.

## Order of installation {#order_cp_install .section}

Refer to the [HCL Connections System Requirements](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0073654) for the Kubernetes versions and platforms tested with the Component Pack.

It is recommended to review all the steps first and perform a system backup before doing the installation/upgrade.

Perform the following steps chronologically, in the order that they appear in the list, to get your Component Pack deployment up and running:
