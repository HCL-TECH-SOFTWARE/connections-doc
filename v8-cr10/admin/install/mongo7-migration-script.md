# MongoDB 5 to MongoDB 7 Migration Guide

This guide provides a detailed process for migrating MongoDB from version 5 to version 7. It is designed for large-scale data migrations and includes compatibility adjustments, setup instructions, and scripts to ensure a smooth transition.


## Prerequisites

1. **Backup**: Ensure a complete backup of MongoDB 5 data on the NFS master node.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Confirm that MongoDB 7 is installed and configured on the Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Internet Access for Bitnami Docker Images**: Ensure internet access is available to download the required Bitnami Docker images (e.g., `docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:5.0`, `docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:6.0`, and `docker.io/bitnami/mongodb:7.0`).
   - If the environment has limited internet access, ensure appropriate access is opened to download these images.
   - Alternatively, pre-download the images in an accessible environment and transfer them to the target system.
4. **Maintenance Window**: Schedule a maintenance window to avoid data loss during migration.

**Note:** Any containerization platform can be used instead of Docker, but the migration script must be adjusted to ensure compatibility with the chosen platform.


## Migration Process

### Step 1: Document Community Templates (Pre-Migration Check)

   In your MongoDB 5 environment, note any community templates created. After migration, these templates should appear in MongoDB 7 to confirm data integrity. Taking screenshots or recording details will help with verification post-migration.

### Step 2: Check MongoDB 7 Pod Status in Kubernetes

   Ensure that the MongoDB 7 pod is already deployed on your Kubernetes cluster before starting migration.

         ```
         # Check MongoDB 7 pod status
         kubectl -n connections get pod | grep mongo7
         ```
   
!!! note
    All MongoDB migration operations described in this document are performed within the **connections** namespace. Please replace the hardcoded **connections** namespace with your desired namespace.

### Step 3: Scale Down MongoDB 7 StatefulSet

   1.  Scale down the MongoDB 7 StatefulSet to 0 to prevent conflicts during migration.

      ```
      # Scale down MongoDB 7 StatefulSet
      kubectl scale sts mongo7 -n connections --replicas 0
      ```

   2. Verify pod termination status using:
   
      ```kubectl get pods -n connections | grep mongo7```

   3. Proceed only when the pods are in the **Terminated** state or no longer listed.

### Step 4: Back Up MongoDB Data on NFS Master Node

 Create a backup of your MongoDB 5 data on the NFS master node. Select a data backup method that suits the volume of data in your environment. For example, you can back up data using a TAR file. After backing up the data, transfer it to a temporary location.  

   ```
   sudo cd /pv-connections
   sudo tar czf $(date +%Y%m%d)-backup.tar.gz mongo5*
   ```

### Step 5: Move MongoDB Data Folders

   1. Create the folder movement script. Open a text editor and save the following code into a file named `move_mongo_folders.sh`.

      ```bash
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # Script to move MongoDB data folders

      # Define source and target prefixes
      SOURCE_PREFIX="mongo5-node"
      TARGET_PREFIX="mongo7-node"

      # Iterate over each source folder and move it to the target, renaming if needed
      for source_folder in ${SOURCE_PREFIX}-*; do
      [ -d "$source_folder" ] || continue  # Skip if no matching folders are found
      target_folder="${TARGET_PREFIX}-${source_folder##*-}"
      [ -d "$target_folder" ] && mv "$target_folder" "${target_folder}-old"
      mv "$source_folder" "$target_folder"
      done
      ```

   2. Make the script executabl:

      ```sudo chmod u+x move_mongo_folders.sh```

   3. Run the script to move data folders:

      ```sudo ./move_mongo_folders.sh```

      This script moves the data from `mongo5-node-*` folders to `mongo7-node-*` folders, renaming any existing `mongo7-node-*` folders by appending `-old` to avoid conflicts.


### Step 6: Set Up NFS on a Separate Machine

   To migrate data using Docker on a separate machine, follow these steps to ensure that the environments can communicate with each other and set up NFS properly.

   1. Install NFS Packages. 
   
      Ensure that NFS packages are installed on both the NFS master (NFS_MASTER) and the separate machine (for example, `server1`). For instance, on CentOS 7, install `nfs-utils` and `cifs-utils`:

      ```sudo yum install -y nfs-utils cifs-utils```

   2. Start the NFS Server.
   
      Start the NFS server on both the NFS master and the separate machine:

      ```
      sudo systemctl start nfs-server
      sudo systemctl status nfs-server
      ```

   3. Ensure Connectivity. 
   
      Verify that the environments can communicate with each other. Ensure firewalls, security groups, and any network configurations allow NFS traffic between the NFS master and server1. 

   4. Configure NFS Exports on NFS Master:
   
      1. Edit the /etc/exports file on the NFS master to specify the directories you want to share with the machine (server1) that will be used for the data migration:

         ```nano /etc/exports```

      2. Add entries for the MongoDB 7 folders, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

         ```plaintext
         /pv-connections/mongo7-node-0/data/db SERVER1_IP(root_squash,anonuid=1001,rw)
         /pv-connections/mongo7-node-1/data/db SERVER1_IP(root_squash,anonuid=1001,rw)
         /pv-connections/mongo7-node-2/data/db SERVER1_IP(root_squash,anonuid=1001,rw)```

      3. Replace:
         - `/pv-connections/mongo7-node-*/data/db` with the actual paths of the shared folders.
         - `SERVER1_IP` with the IP address of the target server (`server1`).

   5. Apply NFS Export Change.
   
      After modifying `/etc/exports`, restart the NFS server and apply the changes:

      ```sudo systemctl restart nfs-server
      sudo exportfs -a```

   6. Mount Shared Folders on Target Server**:
   
      1. On the target machine (for exmaple, `server1`), create directories to mount the shared folders:

         ```bash
         sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mongo7-node-0/data/db
         sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mongo7-node-1/data/db
         sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mongo7-node-2/data/db
         ```

      2. Mount the shared folders from the NFS master to these directories:

         ```bash
         sudo mount NFS_MASTER_IP:/pv-connections/mongo7-node-0/data/db /mnt/mongo7-node-0/data/db
         sudo mount NFS_MASTER_IP:/pv-connections/mongo7-node-1/data/db /mnt/mongo7-node-1/data/db
         sudo mount NFS_MASTER_IP:/pv-connections/mongo7-node-2/data/db /mnt/mongo7-node-2/data/db
         ```

      3. Replace `NFS_MASTER_IP` with the IP address of the NFS master.

   7. Verify NFS Mount. 

      Confirm that the shared folders are properly mounted by listing their contents:

      ```bash
      sudo ls /mnt/mongo7-node-0/data/db
      sudo ls /mnt/mongo7-node-1/data/db
      sudo ls /mnt/mongo7-node-2/data/db
      ```

### Step 7: Create and Run `mongo_migration.sh` Script

   This step needs to be executed on the system where the Docker environment is configured and the MongoDB data is accessible via NFS. If a dedicated migration server (e.g., server1) is being used, ensure Docker is properly installed and set up on that machine.

   1. Save the `mongo_migration.sh` script.
   
      Open a text editor and save the provided [mongo_migration.sh](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/connections-mongo7/mongo_migration.sh) script into a file named `mongo_migration.sh`.  

   2. Make the script executable:

      ```sudo chmod u+x mongo_migration.sh```

   3. Run the migration script:

      ```sudo ./mongo_migration.sh```

      The script will start a temporary MongoDB container to retrieve replica set information, incrementally upgrade MongoDB versions, update the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV), and perform necessary configuration changes for MongoDB 7.

### Step 8: Scale Up MongoDB 7 StatefulSet

   1. Once migration is complete, scale up the MongoDB 7 StatefulSet to the desired replica count. For example:

      ```# Scale up MongoDB 7 StatefulSet
      kubectl scale sts mongo7 -n connections --replicas 1```

   2. Connect to MongoDB Pod to Check Replica Set Status.
   
      1. To inspect the replica set status, connect to the MongoDB pod and execute the following command (adjust the hostname and pod name to match your deployment):
   
         ```sh
         kubectl exec -it mongo7-0 -c mongo7 -n connections -- mongosh --tls --tlsCertificateKeyFile /etc/mongodb/x509/user_admin.pem --tlsCAFile /etc/mongodb/x509/mongo-CA-cert.crt --host mongo7-0.mongo7.connections.svc.cluster.local --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism MONGODB-X509 -u C=IE,ST=Ireland,L=Dublin,O=IBM,OU=Connections-Middleware-Clients,CN=admin,emailAddress=admin@mongodb --eval "rs.status()"
         ```
         This command will display the current state of all members in the replica set, helping diagnose any issues.

      2. If a member of the replica set remains in the `"stateStr": "RECOVERING"` state for an extended period and does not transition back to "SECONDARY" or "PRIMARY", you may need to restart the affected pod to help it rejoin the replica set.

         To do this, delete the affected pod using the following command. For example, if mongo7-0 is affected, run:

         ```sh
         kubectl delete pod mongo7-0 -n connections
         ```

### Step 9: Restart MongoDB-Related Services

   After completing the migration steps, restart any services that depend on MongoDB to ensure they properly connect to MongoDB 7.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n connections delete pod $(kubectl get pods -n connections | awk '/^appregistry-service|^community-template-service|^itm-services|^people-idmapping|^people-migrate|^people-relation|^people-scoring/ {print $1}')
   ```

### Step 10: Verify Migration

   1. Check Pod Status. Ensure the MongoDB 7 pod is running:
   
      ```bash
      kubectl -n connections get pod | grep mongo7
      ```
   2. Validate Community Templates.

      Confirm that previously created community templates appear correctly in MongoDB 7.

### Step 11: Post Installation and Data Migration Cleanup

   After the installation of MongoDB 7 and data migration have been completed and verified, the following configuration settings and folders are no longer needed and can be safely removed:

   1. Remove the mounts on that were created on the target machine (i.e. server1)
   2. Remove the following folders created by the move_mongo_folders.sh on the NFS master node 

      ```sh
      rm -rf /pv-connections/mongo7-node-0-old
      rm -rf /pv-connections/mongo7-node-1-old
      rm -rf /pv-connections/mongo7-node-2-old
      ```

   3. Remove the following in the /etc/exports on the NFS master node
   
      ```sh
      /pv-connections/mongo7-node-0/data/db SERVER1_IP(root_squash,anonuid=1001,rw)
      /pv-connections/mongo7-node-1/data/db SERVER1_IP(root_squash,anonuid=1001,rw)
      /pv-connections/mongo7-node-2/data/db SERVER1_IP(root_squash,anonuid=1001,rw)
      ```
