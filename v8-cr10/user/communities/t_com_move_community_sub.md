# Moving a community to become a subcommunity of another community {#t_com_move_subcommunity_sub .concept}

Integrate diverse communities by moving a community to become a subcommunity of another community.

You can move a top-level community to become a subcommunity of another parent, or move a subcommunity from one parent to another.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to move.
2.  Click **Community Actions** and select **Move Community** from the list.
3.  In **Make this a subcommunity of**, type the name of the intended parent community. Select a community from the suggestions that display and click **Move**.
4.  If required, confirm that you want to add the members or owners, then click **Move** again. The community is now a subcommunity of the community you specified.

## Results {#section_d1z_svy_25b .section}

The community is now a subcommunity of the community you specified. Note that a subcommunity cannot be less restrictive than its parent. Therefore, when you move a community, the access level of the community that is being moved may be modified. For more information, see [Moving communities](c_com_move_community.md).

## Change your mind? {#section_hbd_qvy_25b .section}

If you want to move the subcommunity to a different parent community, simply repeat the previous steps. If you want to make the subcommunity a top-level community again, follow the steps in [Moving a subcommunity to become a top-level community](t_com_move_community_reparent.md).
