# Organizing gallery files {#t_com_migrate_media_com_gallery .task}

You can put gallery files in community folders and showcase files in the Gallery app.

Improve the organization and visibility of your gallery files by putting them in community folders on the community Highlights page.

1.  Create a community folder where you can store media gallery content. For more information, see [Managing community folders](t_com_manage_folders.md).

2.  Select and [move the files that you want to put in the new folder](t_com_manage_folders.md).


Add a Gallery to the community Highlights page and set it up to display files in the folder you created. For more information, see [Configuring a gallery to display files and folders](t_com_config_gallery.md).
