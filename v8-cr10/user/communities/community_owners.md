# Owners - manage your community effectively {#cframe .reference .welcomePage}

Give your community and its members the tools they need to collaborate.

-   **[Adding members to grow your community](../communities/c_com_add_members.md)**  
Add members to make your community flourish. You can also invite people to join the community. If the community is moderated, you can decide whether to accept or reject incoming membership requests. To add multiple members, use the import tool on the Members page.
-   **[Managing your community to keep it relevant](../communities/c_com_manage_communities.md)**  
Edit your community to update its basic information or the apps associated with it. If the community is no longer needed or was created in error, you can delete it.
-   **[Keeping your apps contemporary](../communities/apps_frame.md)**  
Take advantage of all the ways you can use apps to engage your community.
-   **[Changing your community name](../communities/renaming_community.md)**  
Understand the process for changing a community name and how this action automatically updates the names of linked applications like Blogs, Forums, and Wikis, including exceptions for manually changed apps names.
