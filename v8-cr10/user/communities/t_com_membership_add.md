# Adding or removing members {#t_com_membership_add .concept}

Extend your community by adding new members. You can add people as either Members or Owners.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select any community that youwant to add members to.
2.  In the community menu, click **Members** then **Add Members**. Then do one or more of the following:

    -   **To add specific people:**
        1.  In the **Members** drop-down list, select **People** and either **Members** or **Owners**.
        2.  In the **Type to find person** field, enter the names of the people that you want to add to the community.
        3.  If you do not see the name that you are looking for, click **Person not listed? Use full search** to search the company directory.
    -   **To add groups of people:**
        1.  In the **Members** drop-down list, select **Groups**.
        2.  In the **Type to find group** field, enter the name of the group that you want to add to the community. Or click **Browse Groups**.
        3.  If you do not see the group that you are looking for, click **Group not listed? Use full search** to search the company directory.
    **Note:**

    -   By default, a community can have up to 100,000 users, but this can be changed by your administrator. A group is counted as one user.
    -   If the community is external and you enter an email address for someone outside of your organization, you are prompted to send that person a guest invitation after you save the membership list. Guest members must first accept the invitation to join as a guest before they can access the communities to which they are added.

    -   Some groups in your organization's directory might contain external users. If you add a group of this type to an internal community, external users have access to the content of that community. Also, the community will not indicate that external users have access to it. Contact your administrator to verify that any groups you add do not contain external users.

3.  Click **Save** to add the members and return to the main **Members** page. The new members receive an email notification. Email notifications are not sent to groups.
4.  If you want to make changes, you can do the following:
    -   To change the access role for a member, click **Edit** and choose the person's new role.
    -   To delete a member from a community, click **Remove** next to the member name.
