# Adding apps and widgets to the Highlights page {#c_com_highlights_widgets .concept}

Community owners can design a Highlights page that includes standard Connections apps as well as widgets that aggregate content for community members.

To add a standard community app or widget:

1.  From the community navigation bar, click **Highlights**. Your Highlights page will include a collection of widgets that mirror some of the apps already available in your community.
2.  On the Highlights page, click **Customize**.
3.  To add an app:
    1.  Select the **Apps** tab then **Add Apps**.
    2.  Select the app that you want to add.

        **Tip:** To add an app from any page in the community \(that is, pages besides the **Highlights** page\), click **Community Actions** and then select **Add Apps** from the list. For more information, see [Adding apps to increase capabilities](c_com_add_widgets.md).

4.  To add a widget:
    1.  Select the **Widgets** tab then **Add Widgets**.
    2.  Select the widget that you want to add.
5.  Repeat steps 2 to 4 until you've added as many as you need or want.

**Tip:**

-   **Hidden Apps** or **Hidden Widgets** is where any apps or widgets that you remove are stored. For Highlights widgets that you store, any changes that you made to settings are preserved so that the customized widget can be added again later.
-   If you want to reorder the apps and widgets featured on the Highlights page, click **Customize** and simply drag and drop content around.

## Working with widgets {#section_ykp_1k1_f5b .section}

The following table lists the widgets you can add to the Highlights page. For details on configuring each type of widget after it's been added, click the widget name to view documentation for that widget.

**Attention:** Some of the widgets include options to configure them for personalization, so that the logged-in user will see content relating specifically to them. The personalization options are not currently supported for the Highlights widgets. Additionally, mobile users of the News widgets in the Highlights app cannot create content in the widgets. These include the News, News - Channel, News - List, News - Overview, and News - Slider widgets.
