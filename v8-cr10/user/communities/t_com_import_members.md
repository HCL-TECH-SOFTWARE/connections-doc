# Importing multiple members {#t_com_import_members .concept}

Add or invite multiple people to join your community using a series or spreadsheet file containing their email addresses.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select any community that you own and want to add members to. You can click the **Filter by** icon ![Filter by icon](images/filter.png) and select **I'm an Owner** from the list to see all the communities that you have Owner access to.
2.  In the community menu, click **Members** then **Import Members**.
3.  Select your desired action:
    -   If you want to automatically add people as either members or owners, select **Add people to the community as** then either **Members** or **Owners** from the drop-down list.
    -   If you want to invite people who you think might be interested in joining your community, select **Invite people to the community**.
4.  Select how to import people using their email addresses:
    -   To enter or paste a series of email addresses, select **Enter comma-separated email addresses** then enter the email addresses of the people that you want to add or invite. Make sure the email addresses are separated by a comma.
    -   To upload a comma-separated value \(.csv\) file, select **Select a CSV file of email addresses** then click **Choose File** to select the file from your local system.
5.  Click **Import**.

**Note:** If the community is external and you enter an email address for a person who is outside of your organization, or your file contains an email address for a person who is outside of your organization, you are prompted to send that person a guest invitation after you click **Import**. Guest members must first accept the invitation to join as a guest user before they can access the communities to which they have been imported as members.
