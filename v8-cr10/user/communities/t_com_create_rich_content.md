# Adding rich content pages to a community {#t_com_create_wiki .task}

Add rich content pages to your community so that you can share content, such as images, with community members.

You must be logged into Communities and be a community owner to add a rich content page to a community. You can add multiple rich text pages to a community.

Community owners can add rich text pages to a community. Community members can view the contents of rich text pages.

1.  To add a rich content page to your community:
2.  Add the Rich Content app to your community and the community Highlights page. For more information, see [Adding apps to increase capabilities](c_com_add_widgets.md) and [Adding apps and widgets to the Highlights page](c_com_highlights_widgets.md) respectively.

    **Note:** You can add multiple rich content pages to your community. Each new page appears beneath the previously added page.

3.  On the community Highlights page, in the **Rich Content** area, click **Add Content**.

4.  Enter your message, then click **Save**.


From the community's Highlights page, you can do the following:
