Search or browse for communities that you're interested in. When you find a community, you can search within it for more detailed information.

## Searching for communities {#section_qbm_hsy_g5b .section}

You can search for a community from any page in Connections using the search box, or you can open the Communities app and filter communities to find what you need:

-   **Using Connections search:** Perform a [quick or advanced search](../eucommon/c_eucommon_search.md) for a community and content within a community.
-   **Filtering views in the Communities app:** From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and then select any of the following views:

    -   **My Communities:** Shows the communities that you already belong to.
    -   **Discover:** Shows all public communities that you can follow or join.
    -   **Invited:** Shows all communities that you are invited to join.
    If you don't see the communities that you want, you can filter the previous views in one of these ways:

    -   Enter a community name, keyword, or tag in the filter search box.
    -   Beside the navigation bar, click the dropdown filter and select a different filter or sorting option from the list.
    -   To filter by other options, such as your role in the community or tags, click the **Filter by** icon ![Filter by icon](images/filter.png) and select from the list that appears.
