Start connecting with people so you can collaborate and view each other's content.

-   **[Searching for people](../profiles/t_pers_search_directory.md)**  
Looking for people to add? Either search for a person by name, or based on their location, expertise, or tags.
-   **[Inviting a person to your network](../profiles/t_pers_invite_network.md)**  
Ready to start collaborating? Invite someone to join your network. Once they accept, they'll be added to your Network Contacts and you can view each other's status updates.
