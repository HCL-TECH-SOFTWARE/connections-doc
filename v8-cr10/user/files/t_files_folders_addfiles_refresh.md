# Using folders {#howdoiaddfilestofolders .concept}

Organize and share files easily using folders. For example, you can add files to folders that you have Editor or Owner access to.

## Creating a new folder { .section}

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Files**.
2.  Click **New** and then **Folder**.
3.  Specify the name of the folder and how you want it shared.
4.  Click **Create**.
5.  To upload new files directly to the folder, open the folder then drag and drop the files from your computer to the content pane.

You can also create subfolders, provided that you have Owner or Editor access to the top-level folder. Keep in mind that subfolders always inherit the sharing settings of the top-level folder.

## Editing folder or subfolder properties { .section}

You must have Owner or Editor access to the top-level folder.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Files**.
2.  In the sidebar, select the folder or subfolder that you want to edit.
3.  Click the arrow next to the folder name in the action bar, then select **Edit Properties**.
4.  Enter your changes and click **Save**.

## Adding uploaded files to a folder { .section}

**Note:** If you add a private file to a public folder, the file will become public.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Files**.
2.  In the sidebar, select the folder or subfolder that you want to edit.
3.  Click the arrow next to the folder name in the action bar, then select **Add Files**.
4.  Select the files you want to add to a folder, then click **Add files**.

**Tip:** Want an easier way? Just drag and drop files to the folder.
