# Working with folders {#t_files_others_folders .concept}

What you can do with folders that you do not own depends on the access level that you have.





## Folder permissions { .section}

There are three primary levels of access for any folder: Owner, Editor, and Reader. Folder owners can choose to allow other people to share files. See [Working with files](t_files_others_files_refresh.md) for the access levels available for files.

To see what access you have for a folder, open the folder page and click the **Sharing** tab.
