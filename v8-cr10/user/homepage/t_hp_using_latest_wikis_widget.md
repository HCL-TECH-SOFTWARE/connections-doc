# Using the Latest Wikis app {#t_hp_using_my_wikis_widget .task}

Use the Latest Wikis app to display a list of wikis that have been updated recently.

The Latest Wikis app allows you to keep current with the latest updates to public wikis. Browsing the app entries is a useful way of finding wikis with recent activity. You can see who last updated a wiki and when they made the update.

-   You can work with the Latest Wikis app in the following ways:
-   To navigate to a wiki to get more information about an update, click the wiki title to open the wiki in the Wikis app. Close the window to return to the Home page.

-   If there are no wiki entries to display, click **Go to your Wiki page** to start a wiki or access other options for working with existing wikis.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
