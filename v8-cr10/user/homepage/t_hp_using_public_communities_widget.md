# Using the My Organization Communities app {#t_hp_using_public_communities_widget .task}

Use the My Organization Communities app to view a list of the most recently updated communities.

The My Organization Communities app displays information about the public communities that have been most recently updated. You can see who last updated the community and when. The app also contains links to the feeds, bookmarks, and forum topics associated with the community. The list is ordered by the most recently updated community.

-   You can work with the My Organization Communities app in the following ways:
-   To view a recently updated community, click the community title. The community opens in the Communities app, where you can view a summary of the most recent updates on the Overview page.

-   If no communities display, click the link provided to open the Communities app and create a new community.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
