# Latest Updates: Keeping up with your network {#concept_qrq_w4x_rsb .concept}

View updates from people and communities that you follow, with the most recent updates first.

With the **Latest Updates** tab of your HCL Connections home page, you can keep up with the actions and status updates of people you're connected to or follow, and who are in communities you're a member of or follow.

## Changing your focus {#section_txk_szk_5sb .section}

You might want to see different kinds of updates at different times. Here are some ways to manage your update stream:

-   Switch the type of updates that you see. Click the down arrow next to the filter-stream option \(**I'm Following** by default\) and select a view from the list of filters:

    **Tip:** The **Saved** option aggregates the updates in which you clicked **Save this** so that you can find them later.

-   Filter your view further to see only the updates from a particular app or tag. Click the Filter content icon ![Filter content icon](images/funnel.png) to choose an app from the list.

    **Note:** You might see a different list depending on what apps your organization deploys from Connections and other products.

-   Make use of the To Do List, Events, and Recommendations apps next to the stream. Learn how by clicking the **Actions** icon ![](images/hamburger_icon.png) next to each app and select **Help**. If you remove one of these apps and want to add it back, click **Customize**.
-   Within an update, click any linked text or graphics to go to its source in Connections.

**Tip:** If your organization deployed Component Pack for Connections, the **Important to Me** bar is displayed at the edge of the screen. Hover over a person's avatar to see action items and their business card, or click an avatar to go to a community's landing page.
