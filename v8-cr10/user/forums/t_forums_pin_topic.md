# Pinning forum topics {#t_forums_pin_topic .task}

Highlight or prioritize important topics by pinning them. When you pin a topic, it stays at the beginning of that forum's topic listing to ensure that it receives attention from forum users.

You must be the forum owner or the Forums administrator to pin a topic in a stand-alone forum. To pin a topic in a community forum, you must be a community owner or the Forums administrator.

Pinning a topic makes that the topic easy to find in a large forum. For example, if you are posting a topic that contains details about an important event, then you can pin the topic so that users can find it easily. Pinned topics are marked with a thumbtack ![Pinned topic icon](iconPin16.png) icon.

**Note:** When you pin a topic in a community forum and the community contains multiple forums, the pinned topic is not displayed at the head of the **Topics** tab on the Forums page. You must open the forum from the **Forums** tab to see pinned topics at the head of the forum.
