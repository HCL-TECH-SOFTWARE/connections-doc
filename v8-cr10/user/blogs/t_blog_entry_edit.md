# Editing or deleting an entry {#concept_dkf_rc3_my .concept}

Changed your mind about an entry? If you have Owner or Author permission, you can edit an entry or delete it from the blog.

With Owner permission, you can manage all blog entries, regardless of whether you created them or not. If you have Author permissions, you can only manage your own entries. To know more about permissions, see [Managing roles and permissions](c_blogs_roles.md).

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Blogs** and then **Manage Entries** for the blog you want to work with.
2.  To edit, click **Edit** next to the entry.

    **Tip:** While editing, if you want to notify another blog that you are linking to it, supply a trackback URL. The notification is sent when you post your entry.

3.  To delete, select the checkbox beside the entry and click **Delete**.

**Note:** As you create or edit an entry, your work is automatically saved every 15 minutes, unless the site administrator changes the interval. If you leave an entry in an unsaved state when you log out of Blogs, you are notified the next time you log in. From that notification message, you can click **Edit** to open the entry and resume work on it, or **Discard** to delete the entry.
