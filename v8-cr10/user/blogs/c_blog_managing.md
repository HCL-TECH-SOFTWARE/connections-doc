# Managing a blog {#concept_vmy_t2q_my .concept}

Are you a blog owner? Learn how to customize your blog, manage blog content, or set blog permissions.

-   **[Managing roles and permissions](../blogs/c_blogs_roles.md)**  
What you can do with blog settings or content depends on your role. Community owners can expand or restrict members' permissions, and add or remove members.
-   **[Creating an announcement](../blogs/t_blogs_announcement.md)**  
An announcement is a great way to get the word out to your whole community of bloggers. If you are a Blogs site administrator, you can post announcements for all users to see.
-   **[Managing entries and comments](../blogs/t_blog_filter_entries.md)**  
As the blog owner, you can view and manage all of the entries and comments in your blog from the Entries page.
-   **[Editing general blog settings](../blogs/t_blog_editing_settings.md)**  
Customize the blog name and description, or change how users can interact with the blog.
-   **[Deleting a blog](../blogs/t_blog_deleting.md)**  
Deleting a blog permanently removes the blog and all its entries. If you are a blog owner, you can delete a blog.
-   **[Resigning from a blog](../blogs/t_blog_resign.md)**  
If you no longer want to participate in a blog, you can resign from it. You cannot resign if you are the only blog owner.
