# Why use a wiki? {#whatarewikis .concept}

A wiki is a collection of content that is created and edited by team members. Wikipedia is the best example of a living, breathing body of knowledge created and updated by thousands. Use wikis to tap into the power of the team to collaborate and build a knowledge base. Everyone can participate if given permission.

## What are some uses for wikis? { .section}

Use wikis to collect best practices, guidelines, specifications, meeting minutes, and more. People who are given access can create a page and @mention other wiki members with questions or comments, right from the wiki. Pages can be updated as new information becomes available.

Wikis can be easily organized with a table of contents and tagged so people can find information in the wiki fast. Anyone can track changes to a wiki by following a wiki or wiki pages. Previous versions of wiki pages are saved so rollbacks to previous pages are available.
