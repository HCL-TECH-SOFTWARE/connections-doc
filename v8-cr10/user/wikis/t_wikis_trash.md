# Deleting wikis and pages {#howdoestrashworkinwikis .concept}

Depending on your wiki access, you can remove wiki pages by moving them to the trash. Pages can then be deleted from the trash or restored to the wiki.

## Before you begin { .section}

With Owner access, you can delete wikis that you own and remove any page within your wiki, regardless of who created the page. You can also permanently delete pages from the trash or restore them to your wiki.

With Editor access, you can move only pages that you created to the trash. When your pages are moved to the trash, you can permanently delete or restore them to the wiki.

With Reader access, you can view pages within the wiki and the trash, but cannot move pages to the trash. You cannot delete or restore pages from the trash either. If you want to restore a page but do not have the necessary access, contact the page owner.

In public wikis, everyone has Reader access to the trash.

## Removing a wiki page { .section}

You must be an Owner or Editor of the wiki. See the preceding information to know the limitations of having Editor access.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Wikis** and select the wiki you want to work on.
2.  Select the page you want to remove.
3.  Click **Page Actions** and select **Move to Trash** from the list.

## What can I do with pages in the trash? { .section}

When pages are moved to the trash, you can restore them to the wiki or permanently delete them. To view removed pages, click **Trash** in the action bar.

**Tip:** Want to act on multiple wiki pages from the trash in one go? Just select the pages you want to restore or delete on a page, then go to the next page, where you can select more wiki pages. The wiki pages you select from each page remain selected.

-   **To restore a page:** Select the checkbox next to the page and then click **Restore**. Restoring pages puts them back under the parent page but does not restore the original order of the pages. If there's no parent page, the pages are restored to the top level of the wiki.
-   **To permanently delete a page:** Select the checkbox next to the page and then click **Delete**. If you want to delete all the pages in the trash, click **Empty Trash**.

    **Important:** When you delete a page from the trash, you cannot undo the action or retrieve the deleted page.


## Deleting a wiki { .section}

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Wikis** and select the wiki you want to delete.
2.  In the Wiki Actions area, click **Delete Wiki**.
3.  Authorize the deletion in the Delete Wiki window, and then click **Delete**.
