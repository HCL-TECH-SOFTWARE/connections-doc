# Getting started {#concept_ttc_wfj_yx .concept}

Ready to begin? Here are the basics, step by step.

-   **[Creating an activity](../activities/c_create_activity.md)**  
The first step of any activity is its creation. You can start from scratch, copy an existing one, or reuse a template.
-   **[Doing more with a to-do](../activities/c_adding_a_todo.md)**  
Try assigning to-do items to team members so you can manage project goals. Later, if you don't want to expand all those sections to look for a single item, you can view all to-dos from the **To-Do List** tab.
-   **[Doing more with an entry](../activities/c_add_entry.md)**  
Entries are the most flexible components of an activity. They can be made to fit any situation by using custom fields.
-   **[Organizing content](../activities/c_organize_sections.md)**  
Sections and entries chunk content into manageable portions, and they're good at it. Try grouping by name, due date, or content type.
-   **[Notifying your members](../activities/c_notify_members.md)**  
Members don't automatically receive notifications from your activity. You can manually notify each member of an update, or have all your members follow the activity to get routine updates.
