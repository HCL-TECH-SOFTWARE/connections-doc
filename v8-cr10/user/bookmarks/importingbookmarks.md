# Importing bookmarks from a web browser {#importbrowserbookmarks .task}

Import bookmarks that you saved in your web browser from the **My Bookmarks** page with the import tool.

To import bookmarks from a web browser, follow these steps.

1.  Follow the help instructions for your browser to create a bookmark export file.

2.  From the **My Bookmarks** page, click **Page Actions** \> **Import Bookmarks**.

3.  Locate the bookmark export file that you created from your web browser.

4.  Choose whether to import all bookmarks or a subset that you specify.

5.  Enter any tags that you want to apply in the **Add Tags** field.

    **Note:** Tags that you add during the import operation are displayed by all imported bookmarks. If the browser bookmark was stored in a folder, the folder name is automatically applied to the bookmark as a tag.

6.  Click **Import**.

    **Troubleshooting:**

    When you export bookmarks from Microsoftâ„¢ Internet Explorer, the exported file might be saved in a format, such as ANSI, that Bookmarks does not support. In that case, you get an error when you try to import the file. After you create the bookmark file, follow these steps to change the format of the bookmarks file to UTF-8 before you import the file.

    1.  Open the Bookmark.htm file in a text editor such as Notepad.
    2.  Click Save As.
    3.  Change the Encoding on the file from ANSI to UTF-8.
    4.  Save and close the text file.
