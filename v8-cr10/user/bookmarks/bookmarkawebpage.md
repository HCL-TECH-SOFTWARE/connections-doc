# Creating a bookmark {#bookmarkawebpage .task}

You can save a web page URL as a bookmark that you and others can use to access a web page.

If you don't have the [bookmark button installed](getstarted-oneapproach.md) for your browser, follow these steps to create a bookmark.

1.  Open a web page that you want to bookmark.

2.  Click the **Public Bookmarks** or **My Bookmarks** tab and click the **Add a Bookmark** button.

3.  Fill in the form and click **Save**.

    **Note:** You can choose to save a bookmark to other HCL Connections applications such as Communities, Blogs, and Activities. For example, you can add a bookmark to a community and post a message for discussion.
