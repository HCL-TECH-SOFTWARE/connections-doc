HCL Connections v8 has reintroduced and optimized the search functionality previously available in release 7.0, allowing users to efficiently navigate various content types such as blogs, forums, bookmarks, and wikis.

- **Improved Search Results**
    
    Search results are now presented in a more user-friendly format, making it easier to identify and access relevant information.

The new search functionality extends to standalone applications such as Community, Blogs, Wiki, and Forum. As well as within community-specific contexts, enabling users to search comprehensively across Blogs, Forums, and Wikis.  These improvements provide a seamless and intuitive content discovery experience to boost productivity and enhance collaboration.
