# Locking files in Connections {#t_files_plugin_lock .task}

Lock files to prevent people from editing them.

The Owners and Editors of files can lock and unlock those files. For example, if you upload a file you are the owner and can lock and unlock that file. If you give a person Editor access to the file, they can also lock and unlock it. When you lock a file, people can still download and read it, but only you can upload new versions of it.

When a file is locked it cannot be edited, but it can still be deleted.

1.  Right-click a file in the sidebar application and choose **Lock File**.

2.  To unlock the file, click **More Actions** \> **Unlock File**
