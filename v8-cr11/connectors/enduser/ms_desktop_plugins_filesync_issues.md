# Viewing and resolving sync issues {#ms_desktop_plugins_filesync_issues .concept}

When sync issues arise between files in your local folder and files on the server, you can resolve the issues from the **Sync issues** dialog.

Occasionally, issues arise that disrupt syncing between local files and the copies on the associated server. For example, if you rename a local file in your sync folder and a file with the new name already exists on the server, an error is logged in the client. When you view the issues for your files, you will be warned about the naming conflict and given tips on how to resolve the problem. For example, to resolve a naming conflict, you must either rename the local file or the conflicting one on the server.

To view sync issues:

-   Click the HCL Connections icon in the system tray and choose **View sync issues**.
-   Right-click a file in your local **sync** folder and choose **HCL Connections** \> **View sync issues**.
