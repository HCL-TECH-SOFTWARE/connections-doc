You can modify the primary source of content and the view to display, as well as some additional options.

The activity stream can draw information from the following places:

-   Layout of Connections classic home page: In the **Layout** field, click **Default** to use the layout and information from this page.
-   Layout of Orient Me home page: In the **Layout** field, click **New**.

    **Note:** For this widget, choosing this option uses a layout with a more modern look and feel, but the views available for the content are the same as those for the classic home page.

-   A community: Skip the Layout field and click **Show Community**, and then type the community's name in the **Source** field.

The **Default Source** field indicates which view of the content is displayed in the activity stream; your choices depend on whether you selected a home page or community.

-   Classic and Orient Me home page views
    -   **Following** - Shows updates to people and things that users are following, and responses to their content
    -   **Status Updates** - Shows updates from users' networks, and people and communities that they are following
    -   **Discover** - Shows what people are sharing and new connections that users can make
-   Community update views
    -   **All** - Shows a summary of recent activity in the community, including status updates from community members.
    -   **Status Updates** - If the administrator enabled this feature in the community, shows the posts that community members make to the community.

**Tip:** If you want to include all of the views for the selected primary source \(with the selected view being the default\), select the **Show Navigation** option to allow users to switch between views. If you want to only show only the selected view, make sure that the **Show Navigation** option is cleared.

## Expected format { .section}

Enabling the following options determines if the associated elements are displayed in the stream:

-   **Show Sharebox** - If enabled, shows a text area for users to share status updates and files.

    **Note:** Users cannot use @mentions within this text area.

-   **Show Navigation**
    -   If no community is in use, shows a navigation with three navigation points \("Following," "Status Updates," and "Discover"\).
    -   If a community is in use, shows a navigation with two navigation points \("All" and "Status Updates"\).
-   **Show Join Community Button** - If enabled, shows a "Join Community" button when the source of a stream is a community, so that a user who isn't a member of the community can join it and post status updates.
