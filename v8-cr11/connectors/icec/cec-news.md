# News {#id_name .reference}

Within this widget single news or news channels can be added. It's suited especially for highlighting specific news on department level.

## Content source { .section}

A Connections Community or a Standalone Blog is defined as content source for this widget. This Community has to contain a blog and at least one blog entry.

## Expected format { .section}

It is possible to display more than one entry in this widget. The first entry is shown with date, headline, picture or video and abstract. All further entries are indicated below with a linked headline. Underneath the titles, the numbers of comments and likes can be indicated with the **Show Comments and Likes** checkbox in the widgets configuration. In the lower right corner there is a **more news** link to the original blog.

At a click on an entry an Embedded Experience Pop Up opens up on the right side next to the widget. The pop-up contains the complete content of the blog entry, including all comments and likes. Within the Embedded Experience the article can be liked/unliked and commented. It also contains an **Open in Community...** link underneath the article that forwards to the actual Blog entry.

You can also display entries in a slider. You simply need to switch from **List** to **Slider** in the edit area. Of course you can select any posts you wish. If the option to show more than one post is chosen, the widget displays a slider to navigate the different entries. By checking the **Slide automatically**-checkbox \(added with Version 13\) you can make the slider rotate through the blog entries automatically.

You can get the Community title as the widget title by entering **%sourceName%** into the widget title

**News Aggregation** allows you to add more than one Channel into the News widget. This means, you can select more than one community to show news from. The news entries will be shown sorted by date. Of course you can also mix selected and latest posts, if you want to.
