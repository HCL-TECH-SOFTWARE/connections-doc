You have different opportunities to use the Saved Search widget. First you can enter a normal search string in the query field like **Business**. Also you can search with a configured Connections-Search. Therefore you have to enter the URL of the Search-Feed. You can get this here:

If you want to have a searchbar in the widget, you have to empty the query field.

**Note:** The Search API is used for this widget. If the Search Index isn't up to date, it might be that the widget will show you old content or nothing. This widget will not be displayed in mobile, because the mobile-app does not support this API.
