# Creating a feed from a Bookmarks view {#settingupafeed .task}

You can subscribe to a feed to make a collection of bookmarks available to you in a feed client of your choosing so that you can access bookmarks without having to use the Bookmarks site. You can also use the feeds to integrate Bookmarks content into other web sites or applications.

To set up a feed, follow these steps.

1.  Navigate to a view of bookmarks that you want to convert to a feed.

    For example, filter the bookmarks list to display a set of bookmarks associated with a person, a tag, or with some other selection criteria.

2.  Click **Feed for These Bookmarks**.

3.  Choose a feed reader and click **Subscribe Now**.


The latest updates now appear directly in your feed reader.
