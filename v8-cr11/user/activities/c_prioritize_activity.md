# Prioritizing activities {#concept_bcx_gkl_5x .concept}

Got an important activity? More important than the others? Prioritize them.

All activities are given a **Normal** priority level by default. Changing it makes an activity easier to find, and more likely to get done.

## Give an activity priority { .section}

The priority level that you assign to an activity is visible only to you. It does not affect the priority that another member assigns to it.

1.  Open your activity.
2.  Click **Activity Actions**, and then change the priority level.

    Priority can be set to:

    -   High Priority
    -   Medium Priority
    -   Normal \(default\)

## Tune out an activity { .section}

Tuning out of an activity removes it from your **My Activities** view. It does not affect what another member sees.

1.  Open your activity.
2.  Click **Activity Actions**, and then click **Mark as Tuned Out**.

## Tune back into an activity { .section}

Tuning back into an activity adds it to the **My Activities** view. It does not affect what another member sees.

1.  Click the **Activities** tab.
2.  In the sidebar, click **Tuned Out Activities**.
3.  Open the activity that you want to tune back into.
4.  Click **Activity Actions**, and then click **Normal Priority \(Default\)**.
5.  The activity is visible the next time you go to your **My Activities** view.
