# Adding the SharePoint app to a community {#task_oqp_ft4_gnb .task}

In organizations where the HCL Connections for Microsoft SharePoint app is enabled, community owners can add the app to their community so that members can access SharePoint files from there.

To access the community widget, you must have the user name and password that you use to access your SharePoint server. If you do not have this information, consult your SharePoint administrator. Documents you upload to the community from SharePoint are available to all members of the community.

To add the SharePoint app to your community:

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to add the app to.

2.  Click **Community Actions** and select **Add Apps** from the list.

3.  Click **SharePoint Library**.

4.  From the community menu, click **Highlights** and find the widget for the **SharePoint Library** app.

5.  If you also want to display the SharePoint Library app on the community's **Highlights** page, follow these steps:

    1.  From the Highlights page, click **Customize**.
    2.  On the **Apps** tab, select **Add Apps** and then **SharePoint Library**.
    3.  Find the **SharePoint Library** card on the Highlights page. To specify the SharePoint content that you want to display in the community, click the **Menu** icon ![App or widget menu icon](images/highlights_menu.png) and select **Edit** from the list.
    4.  In the **URL** field, enter the URL for the SharePoint content that you want to display, then click **Add**. The documents in SharePoint will become available to all members of the community. For example, following the https, your URL might look like this: mycompany.sharepoint.com/sites/SharePointSite/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

Community members can access the documents from the **SharePoint Library** tab.

**Note:** If members are using incognito mode in Google Chrome, they must update cookie settings to allow all cookies to enable the SharePoint app in incognito mode.
