# Inviting people to join {#concept_e3d_yvl_cy .concept}

Reach out to people who you think might be interested in your community by inviting them to become members. The invitees receive an email that invites them to join.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to invite people to.
2.  In the community menu, click **Members** then **Invite Members**.
3.  In the **Type to find person** field, enter the name of the person that you want to invite to the community, and select their name from the list that appears.

    **Tip:** To check if the person is an external user, hover over their name and see if the external user icon ![External user icon](images/ext_user.jpg) displays. If the community is an external-restricted community and the proposed name is not what you're looking for, enter the person's email address and click the plus icon.

4.  Click **Send Invitations**.
