# Sharing information in a community blog {#community_blog_frame .reference}

Create a community blog to keep members informed about announcements and other updates in your community.

The following topics cover how to create and manage a community blog. For more information on adding the Blog app, see [Adding apps to increase capabilities](c_com_add_widgets.md).

-   **[Adding a blog to your community](../communities/t_com_creating_community_blog.md)**  
Use a blog to share information with your community in an efficient, dynamic style.
-   **[Managing your community blog](../communities/t_com_community_manage_blog.md)**  
Manage settings such as name, display, and commenting for the community blog. You can also add files and links to mak the blog more useful, or hide the blog altogether if it's no longer relevant.
-   **[Reviewing community blog content](../communities/reviewing_blog_entries_and_comments.md)**  
If community members have only Draft permissions, you can review their submissions and approve or reject accordingly. If comment moderation is enabled for your community blog, you can also go through the submitted comments.
