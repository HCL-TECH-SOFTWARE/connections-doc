# Connecting with other blogs {#concept_e4g_l2q_my .concept}

Get involved in the conversation! Find blogs to follow, like entries that interest you, and share your own entries with others.

-   **[Posting a comment](../blogs/t_blog_new_comment.md)**  
Get involved in the discussion and comment on a blog post or respond to a comment on your own.
-   **[Liking an entry](../blogs/t_blog_entry_recommend.md)**  
Let the author know that you liked a particular blog entry and recommend it to others. Liking an entry gives that entry more relative importance when the entries are sorted by using the **Likes/Votes** option on the **Public Blogs** page.

Find new blogs and entries that matter to you.
-   **[Following a blog](../blogs/t_blog_follow.md)**  
Follow a blog to stay up-to-date on new posts and announcements. The notifications are delivered to the Latest Updates view of your home page.
-   **[Notifying a user about a blog entry](../blogs/t_blog_entry_notify.md)**  
Notify other blog users about an entry that you think might be of interest.
-   **[Flagging an entry as inappropriate](../blogs/t_blog_entry_inappropriate.md)**  
See something you consider inappropriate? Flag the entry so that a reviewer can determine whether to remove it from the blog. This feature must be enabled by your administrator.
