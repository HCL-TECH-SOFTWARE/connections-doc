    -   **General Settings**: Set the basic properties, such as the name, description and how many entries to display \(the default value is 25\). By default, a blog is active and available to the blog community.
    -   **Voting** \(Ideation Blogs only\): Modify options for how users vote on ideas in an Ideation Blog. The default is to allow unlimited voting, but you can specify a voting limit per blog user.
    -   **Internationalization Settings**: Set time zones.
    -   **Comments**: Select if you want users to comment on a blog. If you choose to moderate comments, you must review and approve comments before they display in a blog.
    -   **Default Comment Settings**: Set preferences to allow comments for new entries, or to set a time limit so that after a specified number of days the comment field is no longer displayed for an entry. You can also apply these settings to existing entries in the log.
    -   **Blog Client API**: Use this setting if you want to use a third-party editor to create blog entries.
4.  When your changes are complete, click **Update Blog Settings** to publish your changes.
