# Filtering search results {#concept_kgp_cyb_ty .concept}

Filter the results that display on the search results page to quickly find the information you need.

## Filtering results {#section_fjr_hyb_ty .section}

From the search results page, choose one or more of the following options to filter your results:

-   Search within a specific application, or for status updates. **All Contents** is selected by default. To filter results to one or more applications, select the app name, for example **Communities**, **People**, or **Bookmarks**. For status updates, select **Status Updates**.

    **Note:** If your organization has not deployed Component Pack, you cannot filter to more than one application at the same time.

-   Use the drop-down filters to further refine your search. The filters available vary depending on the app or apps that you select.
-   Click **People** to display only the results that are associated with a given person.
-   Click **Tags** to search the results for specific tags or keywords. This app displays up to 50 of the tags associated with your search results. Click a tag to display any results that contain that tag. Select a related tag from the **Related Tags** area if you want to further refine your search.
-   Click **Dates** to display only those results that are associated with a specified year or month. This app displays up to 250 of the dates associated with your search results.
-   Click **Trending** to view the latest hot topics in your organization. This app displays only when you select the **Status Updates** filter, and only in standard Connections deployments \(without Component Pack\). It displays up to 50 of the hottest trends associated with your search results.

## Good to know {#section_fdq_zd2_ltb .section}

-   When you select the **Communities** filter, you see an additional drop-down filter, **Everything from Communities**. If you want to limit your results to *a list of the communities* relevant to your search term, select **Communities** from the drop-down. If you want results that return relevant content *within the communities*, select **Content in Communities**.

-   In whatever app or apps you're filtering on, if you want to limit search results to people or things whose names contain your term, select the **Find in Title/Name only** checkbox.

**Note:** These tips apply only if your deployment includes Component Pack.

Instead of just words, try entering [advanced search terms](c_eucommon_search_adv_search_options.md).

If you're using a standard Connections deployment \(without Component Pack\), try [performing an advanced search.](t_eucommon_perform_advanced_search.md)
