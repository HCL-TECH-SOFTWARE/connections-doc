# Keeping up with notifications {#notifications .task}

No matter where you are in HCL Connections, you can open the Notification Center and scan for important commitments and updates to keep you plugged in and on task.

Notifications can help you stay on track or swiftly shift gears depending on what is required in the moment. The Notifications bell ![Notifications alarm bell](images/notifications_8.png) persists on all applications in the navigation bar. When notifications are available, a badge displays indicating the number of updates for you, for example ![](images/notification_badge.png). Click the bell icon to view your notifications. The dot that appears next to an update indicates its unread or read status.

The following are some actions you can take.

- Scan your tasks to see what tasks are due.

    If Outlook is configured for your deployment you can see Outlook tasks in the Action Center.

- View recent notifications or focus on top updates from the people and communities you pinned.

- Click an update to view in full and respond to it.

- Mark updates as read.

## Enhancements to Notification bells feature

HCL Connections v8.0 enhanced the Notification bells therefore, providing a better user experience. These enhancements includes:

- The Top Updates menu counter is independent of the notification bell counter. While both indicate unread notifications, the Top Updates counter includes mentions and action items that are not counted in the Notification icon's counter.
- The notification bell counter will be cleared when you click on the bell icon or when you view a notification from the Top Updates or Latest Updates menu.
- The "mark all read" option does not affect the counter. It only removes the bold font from clicked notifications in the notification bell.
- The notification bell counter will clear only when all items have been seen in the Top Updates Menu.
- Even when notifications have been seen through the Top Updates Menu, the notification bell menu items may still appear in bold. You can click on them or use "mark all read" to remove the bold formatting.

## Feature limitations

The Notification Center provides a comprehensive overview of your notifications, however, the following limitations are needed to be considered:

- Mentions count represents only mention events and will be cleared only after clicking on Mentions from the Top Updates filter menu.
- Responses counter is similar to the Notification bell counter and both are synced, clearing on click of each other.
- The My Notifications counter from the personal filter on the Latest page is also similar to Responses and the Notification bell counter.
