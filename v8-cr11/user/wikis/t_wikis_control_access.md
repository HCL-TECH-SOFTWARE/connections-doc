# How do I manage wiki members and access? {#howdoicontrolaccesstomypages .task}

When you create a wiki, you are the wiki owner. As an Owner, you can control who can read, edit, and manage the wiki.

**Note:** Access to a community wiki is managed by community owners. Community owners can grant either an Editor or Reader role to community members. For further details, see [Assigning app roles for community members](../communities/managing_roles_for_community_members.md).

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Wikis** and select the wiki you want to work on.

2.  In the action bar, click the **Members** tab and then complete any of the following steps:
