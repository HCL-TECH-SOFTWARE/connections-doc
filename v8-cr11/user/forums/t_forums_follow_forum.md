# Following forums and forum topics {#t_forums_follow_forum .task}

Follow a forum when you want to receive notifications about the latest updates to the forum. If you are interested in a particular forum thread, you can also follow forum content at topic level.

When you follow a forum, you receive notifications about recent updates to the forum. Follow a forum topic to keep up-to-date with the progress of a particular discussion.

**Notes:**

-   When you create a forum, you automatically follow that forum; you do not have to complete any other steps to follow the forum.
-   When you are already following a community, you do not have to follow its forums or forum topics separately. Any updates about community forums are automatically included when you follow the parent community.
-   External users cannot follow forums.
