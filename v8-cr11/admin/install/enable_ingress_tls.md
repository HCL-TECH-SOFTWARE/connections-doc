# Enabling secure traffic to the ingress controller

This guide describes the steps required to enable TLS (HTTPS) traffic to the ingress controller for the Component Pack. The process involves generating a TLS certificate, configuring the ingress controller to use it, and ensuring secure communication between the IBM HTTP Server (IHS) and the ingress controller.

## Prerequisites

- Access to your Kubernetes ingress-nginx ingress controller
- Administrative access to the Component Pack load balancer (for exmaple, HAProxy, if used)
- Administrative access to IBM HTTP Server (IHS)

## How to enable TLS for the ingress controller

Perform the following steps to enable TLS (HTTPS) traffic to the ingress controller for the Component Pack.

   1. Generate a TLS Certificate
   
      As part of the [bootstrap installation process](cp_install_services_tasks.md#ingresscomm_ingress), a self-signed TLS certificate is automatically generated for the ingress controller. If you prefer to use a different certificate, you can update the `ingress-nginx-tls-secret` secret with your own certificate.  Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

      The [Set up community ingress](cp_install_services_tasks.md#comm_ingress) step configures the ingress controller to use the `ingress-nginx-tls-secret` secret as the default SSL certificate.  If you want to use a different secret containing your preferred certificate, you can patch the cnx-ingress deployment with the `--default-ssl-certificate`flag to specify a new secret.  For more information about TLS setup, refer to the [ingress-nginx documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/).

      If the `--default-ssl-certificate` setting has changed, restart the ingress controller deployment by executing the following command:

      ```kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart deployment cnx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller```

   2. Configure the Component Pack load balancer to use the TLS Port

      If applicable, configure the load balancer (for example, HAProxy) to listen on the TLS port and forward traffic in TCP mode to the backend ingress controller service.  The controller is configured to use port 32443 for HTTPS traffic as described in [Set up community ingress](cp_install_services_tasks.md#comm_ingress).

      1. Sample HAProxy configuration in `<<HAPROXY_DIR>>/haproxy.cfg`

         ```
               frontend cnx_ingress_https
                  bind *:32443
                  mode tcp
                  option tcplog
                  timeout client  10800s
                  default_backend masters_cnx_ingress_https

               backend masters_cnx_ingress_https
                  mode tcp
                  option tcplog
                  option tcp-check
                  balance roundrobin
                  default-server inter 10s downinter 5s rise 2 fall 2 slowstart 60s maxconn 1000 maxqueue 1024 weight 100
                  server <<worker-1.example.com>> <<worker-1.example.com>>:32443 check
                  ......
                  server <<worker-n.example.com>> <<worker-n.example.com>>:32443 check
         ```

         Where `<<worker-1.example.com>>` to `<<worker-n.example.com>>` are the Component Pack workers.  

      2. Reload or restart the HAProxy process to apply the change.


   3. Import the Certificate into IBM HTTP Server (IHS)

      To ensure secure communication between IBM HTTP Server (IHS) and the ingress controller, import the TLS certificate into the IHS keystore.

      1. Download the Certificate from the Ingress Controller

         On each IHS server, use `openssl` to retrieve the certificate from the ingress controllerâ€™s endpoint.  

         Example:

         ```sh
               
         openssl s_client -servername <<INGRESS_HOST>> -connect <<INGRESS_HOST>>:32443 -showcerts < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > ingress-nginx-cert.pem
         ```

         Where `<<INGRESS_HOST>>` is the hostname used to access the ingress controller externally.  This is typically the load balancer (for example, HAProxy, if applicable), or the Component Pack worker node hosting the ingress controller.

      2. Import the Certificate into the IHS Keystore

         Use the `gskcapicmd` utility to import the downloaded certificate into the IHS keystore, such as:

         ```<<IHS_DIR>>/bin/gskcapicmd -cert -add -db <<IHS_KDB_FILENAME>> -pw <<IHS_KDB_PASSWORD>> -label "ingress-root-cert" -file ingress-nginx-cert.pem```

         Where `<<IHS_DIR>>` is the IHS program directory, `<<IHS_KDB_FILENAME>>` is the IHS keystore file path and `<<IHS_KDB_PASSWORD>>` is the keystore password.

         **Note:** If the certificate already exists, you can delete it before reimporting by running:
            
         ```sh
         <<IHS_DIR>>/bin/gskcapicmd -cert -delete -db <<IHS_KDB_FILENAME>> -pw <<IHS_KDB_PASSWORD>> -label 'ingress-nginx-cert'
         ```


   4. Configure IBM HTTP Server (IHS) to Use HTTPS for Ingress Resources

      Update the IHS configuration to enable SSL and listen on the TLS port.  

      1. Update Ingress Resources Endpoints to use HTTPS by executing the following:
   
         ```
         sed -i -E 's|http://([^:]+):32080|https://\1:32443|g' <<IHS_DIR>>/conf/httpd.conf
         ```

      2. Add or update IHS configuration to enable TLS support for proxying HTTPS connections
      
         This line can be placed below the SSLProtocolDisable setting in `<<IHS_DIR>>/conf/httpd.conf`:

         ```
         SSLProxyEngine On
         ```

      3. Run the following command to reload or restart the IHS to apply the change:
   
         ```
         <<IHS_DIR>>/bin/apachectl -k graceful
         ```
