# Install on Windows {#setup-editors-install-install-on-windows .task}

The Window installation uses a Windows installer program.

    -   The host server.
    -   The WebSphere Application Server Console.

1.  Determine the Connections paths \(customization\_path and provision\_path\).

    2.  Expand **Environment** and click the **WebSphere variables** link.
