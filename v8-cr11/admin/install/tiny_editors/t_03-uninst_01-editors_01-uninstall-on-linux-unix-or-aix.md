# Uninstall the Tiny Editors Integration on Linux or Unix {#uninst-editors-uninstall-on-linux-unix-or-aix .task}

Running the uninstaller script will automate the removal of the Tiny Editors Integration on Linux or Unix.

Before you begin:

-   Determine the host\_name of the server hosting HCL Connectionsâ„¢.
-   Get user access as the HCL Connections installer or higher administrative permissions, on both:
    -   The host server.
    -   The WebSphere Application Server Console.

1.  Determine the Connections paths \(customization\_path and provision\_path\).

    1.  Log in to the web interface of the WebSphere Application Server Console.

        The default address is: https://host\_name:9043/ibm/console

    2.  Expand **Environment** and click the **WebSphere variables** link.

    3.  Find the **CONNECTIONS\_CUSTOMIZATION\_PATH** in the variables list and record the value which will be referred to as customization\_path from this point.

    4.  Find the **CONNECTIONS\_PROVISION\_PATH** in the variables list and record the value which will be referred to as provision\_path from this point.

2.  **Attention:** We strongly recommend:

-   Setting up SSH key access to the Connections host server.
-   Using a local SSH agent to avoid password prompts when logging in via SSH.
The following script makes numerous connections, and connection prompts for a password if SSH keys are not used.

3.  Run the uninstall script located in the root directory of the Tiny Editors for HCL Connections package as follows:

    ```
    ./uninstall.sh user@host\_name customization\_path provision\_path/webresources 
    ```

    **Note:** This command will automatically backup any existing configuration it finds in

    -   customization\_path/javascript/tiny/editors/connections
    -   customization\_path/javascript/ephox/editors/connections
    -   customization\_path/javascript/ephox/editlive/connections
    If you do not wish for a backup to be created run the uninstall script with the optional `--no-backup` parameter, e.g.:

    ```
    ./uninstall.sh --no-backup user@host\_name customization\_path provision\_path/webresources 
    ```

    ```
    ./uninstall.sh root@p-ce-conncr5-01 /shared_content/customization /shared_content/provision/webresources
    
    Removing Tiny Editors for HCL Connections from root@p-ce-conncr5-01
    
    Deleting integration code...
    
    Existing configuration detected. Backing up and removing:
      from: /shared_content/customization/javascript/tiny/editors/connections
       to:  /shared_content/customization/javascript/tiny/editors/tiny-editors-connections-backup-2019-08-21_14:17
    
    
    Uninstall complete
    
    For the changes to take effect, please perform the required post-customization step, as described in
      https://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v6/admin/customize/t_admin_common_customize_postreq.html
    ```

4.  Follow the [post-customization steps](https://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v6/admin/customize/t_admin_common_customize_postreq.html) to ensure the server cache is updated.

5.  Verify the uninstall by browsing to the edit screen for a wiki or blog to verify that the Tiny editors are not being loaded and that it has reverted to the default editor.

    **Note:** If after performing this step Tiny Editors for HCL Connections is still available then [restarting the Common enterprise application](t_restart-common-app.md) may be necessary to force a cache update.
