# Configuring the Customizer component {#cp_config_customizer_intro .task}

Configure the Customizer offering of the Component Pack for HCL Connections™ by setting up a reverse proxy server.

Connections™ Customizer is a proxy service that lets you modify the Connections user experience. Customizer intercepts and modifies requests from clients and responses from servers, so it can customize anything that flows through it, such as the behavior of APIs or the look-and-feel of the user interface.

Connections Customizer performs modifications by injecting JavaScript, CSS, or other web resources into the HTML pages returned by Connections in response to end-user requests. Requests are generated when the user navigates in standard Connections apps such as Communities, Profiles, Files, and Homepage. The customization details \(typically, which requests should be modified, and what code should be inserted\) are defined by apps stored in the Connections App Registry.

After you configure Connections Customizer, developers can create apps that customize your organization's interface. You can deploy the apps using the App Registry, as explained in [Managing Connections Customizer apps](../customize/customize_manage_customizer_apps.md).

For an example showing how to configure NGINX as a reverse proxy for Customizer, see [Configuring the NGINX proxy server for Customizer](cp_config_customizer_setup_nginx.md).

For information on creating apps with Connections Customizer, see [Injecting customizations into Connections pages](../customize/customize_inject_customizations.md).

A reverse proxy server is required to forward HTTP requests to mw-proxy for customizations to be applied with the HCL Connections Customizer component. Any reverse proxy application with the appropriate configuration rules can be used. The following sample guide provides steps on how to configure an NGINX proxy server to function as a reverse proxy server for the Connections Customizer component.

For environments that use IBM Security Verify Access (formerly Security Access Manager), configure WebSEAL junctions for Connections Customizer.
-   **[Changing maximum allowed HTTP header size](../install/changing_maximum_allowed_http_header_size.md)**  
The Nodejs server code enforces a maximum HTTP header size on requests. In Nodejs v8 and v12, the maximum HTTP header size was 8 KB. For v14 and later versions, it was 16 KB. In Nodejs v11.6.0 and later versions, the command line parameter `*--max-http-header-size*` was introduced, allowing you to customize the maximum size.
