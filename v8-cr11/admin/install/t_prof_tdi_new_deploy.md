To deploy IBM Security Directory Integrator (SDI) into a new install of HCL Connections \(not for upgrading from previous versions of Connections & TDI\) perform this procedure.

|Option|SDI Deployment Steps          |
|------|------------------------------|
|If you are installing a new deployment of Connections 8.0|For a new deployment of Connections 8.0, you must install SDI version 7.2 along with the supported fix pack and JRE, and use them together with Connections 8.0. Perform the following:<br></br><br>1. To download third-party software, visit [My HCLSoftware](https://my.hcltechsw.com/). You can find Security Directory Integrator (SDI) v7.2 under **HCL Connections** > **Third Party Software**.</br><br>2.  Upgrade SDI to to the latest supported Fixpack (see the detailed installation instructions in the SDI Fix Pack ReadMe). Replace the existing `UpdateInstaller.jar` with the version included in the latest SDI fix pack, located in your `TDI/V7.2/maintenance` directory. To install the latest fix pack, navigate to the `TDI/V7.2/bin` directory and run the following command. This example demonstrates the installation of Fix Pack 6.</br><br>```./applyUpdates.sh -update /install/TDI72/7.2.0-ISS-SDI-FP0006/SDI-7.2-FP0006.zip```</br><br>3.  Oracle: Download the JDBC Database Drivers for [Oracle 19c](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-ucp-19-6-c-downloads.htm).</br><br>4.  Microsoft SQL: Download the [SQL Server JDBC 4.2 driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/release-notes-for-the-jdbc-driver?view=sql-server-ver16#42) from the Microsoftâ„¢ web site and follow the instructions to extract the driver files. HCL Connections uses the `sqljdbc42.jar` file.</br><br>5.  DB2: Download the `db2jcc4.jar` from My HCLSoftware [DB2 Driver for JDBC](https://my.hcltechsw.com/downloads/connections/connections3rd/db2) </br><br>6.  If you need to populate the Profiles database with people from your company's LDAP, then you must use the Population Wizard that is packaged with Connections. Refer to [Populating the Profiles database](t_prof_install_profiles_db.md), [Using the Profiles population wizard](t_prof_populate.md), and [Using the Profiles population wizard in silent mode](t_silent_population_wizard.md) for additional information.</br><br>7.  To keep the users in LDAP and the Profiles database in sync you must manually download and install the SDI solution directory tdisol that is packaged with Connections.</br><br>Refer to [Manually populating the Profiles database](t_prof_populate_manual.md) for additional information.</br>|
|Installing IBM Java 8.0 JRE for SDI|SDI needs to run with Java 8, the following steps will update SDI with Java 8 and the IBM Java 8 JRE for SDI 7.2 runtime. The latest supported JRE for SDI 7.2 runtime can be download from the [My HCLSoftware](https://my.hcltechsw.com/downloads/connections/connections3rd/sdi/7.2) in the **HCL Connections** > **Third-Party Software** > **IBM Security Directory Integrator for Connections**. <br>1.  Install the Java 8 runtime supported by the latest fix pack for SDI 7.2. </br><br>2.  Install the latest supported fix pack for SDI 7.2. Refer to the [Connections 8.0 System Requirements](https://help.hcl-software.com/connections/latest/admin/overview/system_requirements.html) for information on the currently supported fix pack. </br><br> **Attention:** Consult the SDI Fix Pack ReadMe file, available on My HCLSoftware, for complete installation instructions and detailed information. </br><br>3.  Remove these jar files from the SDI product, as they will conflict with the newer Spring implementations used by Connections. These jars are not required for the HCL Connections TDI pipelines.</br><br>```SDI_HOME_DIR/jars/3rdparty/others/ActiveMQ/spring-beans.jar</br><br>SDI_HOME_DIR/jars/3rdparty/others/ActiveMQ/spring-context.jar</br><br>SDI_HOME_DIR/jars/3rdparty/others/ActiveMQ/spring-core.jar</br><br>SDI_HOME_DIR/lwi/runtime/messaging/eclipse/plugins/org.apache.activemq_5.2.0/lib/spring-beans-2.5.6.jar</br><br>SDI_HOME_DIR/lwi/runtime/messaging/eclipse/plugins/org.apache.activemq_5.2.0/lib/spring-core-2.5.6.jar</br><br>SDI_HOME_DIR/lwi/runtime/messaging/eclipse/plugins/org.apache.activemq_5.2.0/lib/spring-context-2.5.6.jar```</br><br>4.  Download and update the jDBC driver names if needed.</br>|
