# Determining the number of IBM WebSphere Application Server nodes to install {#t_install_was_deploy_options .task}

The HCL Connections installation wizard creates server instances that require each node to have an application server. Have in place the hardware you need to install IBM® WebSphere® Application Server on the Deployment Manager and the nodes you are setting up for an HCL Connections cluster.

Determine the deployment option and the number of systems you need for your deployment. For more information, see [Deployment options](../plan/c_planning_the_installation.md).

    !!! note
        You can deploy one node on the same system as the DM but you must use separate systems for all other nodes in a cluster.
