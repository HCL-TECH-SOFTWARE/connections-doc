# Verifying that the Profiles Worker is running correctly {#ts_t_enable_was_traces .task}

View tracing information in the log files to help you verify that the Profiles Worker is running as expected.

The Profiles Worker is the process that sends the user lifecycle commands to the other HCL Connections™ applications. The Profiles Worker propagates user data, such as user metadata and state, from the Profiles database to the other applications. This process is run every 30 seconds.

1.  Verify that the lifecycle events scheduled task is enabled. Open profiles-config.xml, search for the ProcessLifeCycleEventsTask scheduled task and ensure that enabled is set to true.

    For information about how to enable trace logging, see [Enabling traces in WebSphere® Application Server](ts_t_enable_was_traces.md).

2.  To verify that the Profiles Worker is running as expected, check SystemOut.log for the following lines:

    ```
    
    [3/9/15 15:02:00:135 GMT] 0000012f NotificationS I   CLFWY0392I: The task ProcessLifeCycleEventsTask for Profiles has begun execution.  
    The task will continue to run at its specified interval, however due to its frequent invocation, its execution will be logged only once per hour.
    [3/9/15 15:02:00:137 GMT] 0000012f NotificationS I   CLFWY0337I: The next run time for the task ProcessLifeCycleEventsTask for Profiles is at 15:04:00.

    ```

    **Note:** Any data was processed during a particular run of the task, is echoed as a separate, timestamped notification in SystemOut.log.

    You can also search for error and informational messages, for example, search for com.ibm.lconn.profiles.config.EnableUserDataPropagation in SystemOut.log
