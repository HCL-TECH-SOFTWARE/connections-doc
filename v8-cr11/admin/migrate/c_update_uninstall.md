# Uninstalling fixes 

If the installation of an fix fails, you can restore your HCL Connections environment to its previous state.

Use the update wizard to uninstall fixes. There are two modes in which you can run the wizard:

-   **[Uninstalling fixes in interactive mode](../migrate/t_uninstall_interim-fix_interactive-mode.md)**</br>  
If the fix that you installed is not working, you can uninstall it using the update wizard in interactive mode.
-   **[Uninstalling fixes in silent mode](../migrate/t_uninstall_interim-fix_silent-mode.md)**</br>  
If the fix that you installed is not working, you can uninstall it using the update wizard in silent mode.
