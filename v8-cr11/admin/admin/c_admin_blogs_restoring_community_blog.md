# Restoring a Community Blog after a Communities database failure {#c_admin_blogs_restoring_community_blog .concept}

If the Communities database fails and is restored from a backup, you can restore the Blogs widget and delete any orphaned data.

When the Communities application experiences a database failure that involves restoring to a backup without replaying the transaction log to the point of failure, the remote data, such as the data associated with a community blog, needs to be restored as well. You can follow a number of steps to ensure a consistent data state for communities and their associated remote applications. You may need to run an admin command to restore community blogs. Restoring a blog will restore the content. If there is any orphaned data, you use another command to delete the orphaned data. The process for recovering remote application data such as a blog after a Communities database failure, is described in the topic *Recovering from a database failure*.
