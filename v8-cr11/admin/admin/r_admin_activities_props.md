This property is necessary if you configured your system for Activities using *Configuring file downloads and uploads through IBM HTTP Server*.

## Purging the events log { .section}

The following list identifies the Activities configuration properties that you can edit directly in the checked-out file. The events log is used to generate the Recent Updates view. Apply settings to control what updates are seen and when they are purged.

**jobs.EventLogPurgeJob.enabled**:   Specifies whether this task runs.

## Changing the save frequency of entries { .section}

As users create or edit entries, their work is automatically saved every 5 minutes, unless you change the interval. If users leave an entry in an unsaved state when they accidentally close their browser, the next time they log in, a notification appears in the My Activities view reminding them that they have an unsaved entry. Autosave is not meant for backing up activities. This feature is provided to help you recover from unexpected events.

Edit the `<Autosave interval="5"/>` element in oa-config.xml to set how frequently entries are automatically saved. The save interval is in minutes.

Deleting this element does not turn off the autosave feature. If you delete the element, entries are saved at the default interval of 5 minutes.

## Assigning tasks to multiple people { .section}

**feature.multiAssignment.enabled**:   You can assign tasks within an activity to multiple people. A task is marked as completed when all assigned users mark the item complete. An activity owner can also mark the activity complete; In this case, the owner sees the following message:

```
Are you sure you want to mark this To Do Item as complete? If you are an assignee and want to complete 
your own status, you can click the checkbox before your name under this To Do Item
```

To enable this feature, uncomment the following line in opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/config/cells/connectionsCell/LotusConnections-config/oa-config.xml and set the value to true:

```
<property name="feature.multiAssignment.enabled">true</property>"
```
