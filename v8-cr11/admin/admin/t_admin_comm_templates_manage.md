# Managing community templates {#t_admin_comm_templates_manage .concept}

With the HCL Connections Administration Console, you can manage Connections features that rely on microservices provided by Component Pack for Connections, such as the community template catalog and templates that you can edit.

Administrators with the CommunityTemplateAdmin role or Connections admin role can access the Template Administration section in the Connections Administration Console.

To access the Administration Console:

1.  Log into Connections with your Connections administrator credentials.
2.  Once logged in, change the url to be `https://your\_connections\_host\_name/cnxadmin/`

    **Note:** The ending slash \(/\) is required.

    Go to the Template Administration user interface to preview, create, update, import, export, and delete community templates.
