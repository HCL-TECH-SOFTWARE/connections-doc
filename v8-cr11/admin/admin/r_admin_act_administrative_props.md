# Activities administrative commands {#r_admin_act_administrative_props .reference}

Use administrative commands to run administrative tasks on the server.

## Administrative commands { .section}

The following sections define the administrative commands that you can use when working with Activities. Each section describes the commands for a specific service. The MemberService and ActivityService commands are described in the first two sections because they are the most commonly used services. The remaining sections describe the remaining services in alphabetic order.

-   [ActivitiesMemberService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actMemberService)
-   [ActivityService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actService)
-   [AccessControlService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#aclService)
-   [ActivitiesConfigService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actConfigService)
-   [ActivitiesScheduler](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actScheduler)
-   [ArchiveService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actArchiveService)
-   [ListService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actListService)
-   [StatisticsService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actStatsService)
-   [TrashCollectionService](r_admin_act_administrative_props.md#actTrash)

Returns a list of activities whose Title field matches the pattern criteria.

Parameters:

-   **inList**

    Previously fetched list of activities.

-   **toMatch**

    Java™ regular expression pattern representing match criteria. This pattern is used to search the title of the activity. The pattern must match the full name and is case sensitive. You can use the following keys:
