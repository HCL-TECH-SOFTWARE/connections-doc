## Configuring Pseudonymization and Cache Expiration

Follow these steps to enable pseudonymization and configure cache expiration:

### 1. Check Out the Configuration File
1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the `bin` directory of your WebSphere Application Server profile:  
   ```bash
   cd C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\bin
   ```

2. Run the following script to check out the `LotusConnections-config.xml` file:  
   ```bash
   wsadmin -lang jython -user <wasadmin> -password <password>
   execfile("connectionsConfig.py")
   LCConfigService.checkOutConfig("<TEMP_DIRECTORY>", AdminControl.getCell())
   ```
   **Note:** Replace `<TEMP_DIRECTORY>` with the path to a temporary working directory. Ensure the directory has write permissions.

---

### 2. Edit the Configuration File
1. Open the checked-out `LotusConnections-config.xml` file in an XML editor.

2. Add or update the following property to enable pseudonymization:  
   ```xml
   <genericProperty name="isPseudonymizationEnabled">true</genericProperty>
   ```

3. (Optional) To configure cache expiration for pseudonymized data, add or update the following property:  
   ```xml
   <genericProperty name="pseudonymization.cache.expiration.time.secs">900</genericProperty>
   ```
   **Note:** The default value is 900 seconds (15 minutes). Adjust this value as needed.

---

### 3. Check In the Configuration File
1. Save the changes and return to the command prompt.

2. Run the following script to check in the updated configuration file:  
   ```bash
   LCConfigService.checkInConfig("<TEMP_DIRECTORY>", AdminControl.getCell())
   ```

3. Synchronize the nodes in the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console to apply the changes.

---

### 4. Restart the System
Restart the WebSphere Application Server to apply the updated configuration.

## How Pseudonymization Works

1. **Inactive Users:**  
   When a user is marked as inactive, their display name is replaced with a pseudonym in the format `@<pseudonymized_name>`.

2. **Cache Lookup:**  
   The system first checks the cache for the user's pseudonymized data. If not found, it fetches the data from the database, caches it, and returns the pseudonymized name.

3. **Fallback:**  
   If pseudonymization is disabled or the user is not inactive, the original display name is returned.

---

**Notes:**
- If pseudonymization is disabled, the system will display the user's original name, regardless of their state.
- Always back up the configuration file before making changes.
