# JavaScript configuration {#javascriptconfiguration .task}

JavaScript configuration is only available in version 1.3 and higher. The JavaScript configuration file, config.js, is used to adjust settings before the editor loads. This file is designed to be self-documenting and provides the ability for advanced JavaScript configuration if necessary. This configuration file can be found by navigating to the directory on your local computer where you extracted the Tiny Editors for HCL Connections package in the config folder..

**Warning:** Critical integration settings are contained in this file. If they are not provided, the integration will throw a JavaScript exception and no editor will be shown.
