# Post-installation tasks for Connections Touchpoint {#c_post-install_tasks_for_touchpoint .concept}

Touchpoint is an onboarding wizard aimed at increasing adoption for first time users. It provides a wizard that runs the user through mandatory steps: accepting policies and suggests content \(people and communities\) to follow in order to prepare a more customized and enhanced experience.

Touchpoint is installed by default during the Connections installation program. Organizations that want to deploy it to users must first change the value of the uiEnabled configuration to true, and can edit other properties as desired.

-   **[Optional: Adjusting Security Directory Integrator \(SDI\) profile functions](../install/t_adjust_tdi_profile_function.md)**  
If you prefer, you can adjust SDI profile functions \(TDISOL/profiles\_functions.js\)Â to match the LDAP structure in your HCL Connections environment.
-   **[Touchpoint configuration properties](../install/tp_r_touchpoint_config_properties.md)**  
Configuration properties in the touchpoint-config.xml file control how users interact with the Touchpoint onboarding feature in HCL Connections.
-   **[Adding a welcome video to Touchpoint](../install/tp_t_add_welcome_video.md)**  
If your organization has enabled the Touchpoint onboarding wizard, you can configure it to include a video to welcome users to HCL Connections.
