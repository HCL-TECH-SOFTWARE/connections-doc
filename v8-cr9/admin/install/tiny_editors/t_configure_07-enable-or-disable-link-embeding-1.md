# Enable or Disable Link Embedding {#setup-editors-configure-enable-or-disable-link-embeding .task}

This section describes the process for enabling and disabling automatic media embedding in the Tiny Editors.

Before you begin: The Tiny Editor Services must be installed and to use the hyperlinking service for media embedding it [must not be disabled in the application.conf](r_application-conf.md#embed.enabled).

1.  Using a plain text editor, open [customization\_path](t_determine-customization-path.md)/javascript/tiny/editors/connections/config.js.

    **Note:** Use a plain text editor to avoid inserting invalid formatting or symbols into config.js. Do not use a rich text editor such as Microsoft Word for editing configuration files.

2.  Locate the property [`linkEmbedEnabled`](r_config-js-sample.md#linkEmbedEnabled) such as `linkEmbedEnabled: true,` and set it to:

    -   `true` to allow the Tiny Editors to embed media links using the hyperlinking service.
    -   `false` to stop the Tiny Editors from embedding media links using the hyperlinking service.
3.  When you have finished making configuration changes, follow the [post-customization steps](https://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v6/admin/customize/t_admin_common_customize_postreq.html) to ensure the server cache is updated.

    **Note:** If the configuration changes do not take affect, [restart the Common enterprise application](t_restart-common-app.md) to force a cache update.
