# Configuring the Tiny Editors Selector roles {#setup-selector-configure .task}

Assigning an editor to users or roles is performed by configuring the [Tiny Editors Selector service](t_01-setup_01-selector_00-summary.md). This step can also be done after installation of Tiny Editors for HCL Connections is complete.

Before you begin: The Tiny Editors Selector service must be started and the editor must be set to `'role-based'`.

1.  Log in to the Web interface for your WebSphere Application Server Console.

    The default location for the WebSphere Application Server Console is: https://your-server-here:9043/ibm/console

2.  Navigate to **Applications** \> **Application Types** \> **WebSphere enterprise applications**.

5.  Select the checkbox in the **Select** column for either:

    -   **tinymceforconnections.user** to assign the TinyMCE editor.
6.  Assign the selected editor by:

    -   Clicking **Map Users...** to assign the editor to individual users.
    -   Clicking **Map Groups...** to assign the editor to a user group.
