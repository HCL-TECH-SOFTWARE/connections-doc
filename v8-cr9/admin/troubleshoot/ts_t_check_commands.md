# Checking events generated by the user life-cycle commands {#ts_t_check_commands .task}

View traces in the log files to get information about the user life-cycle commands that are sent from Profiles to the other HCL Connections™ applications.

User life-cycle commands are built on top of the event infrastructure. When an update is made to a user using one of the life-cycle commands, a message is sent over the event infrastructure from Profiles to the other applications.

1.  To check that the user life-cycle commands are being sent from Profiles to the other applications, complete the following steps.
2.  Enable trace logging for the com.ibm.lconn.lconn.events process in the WebSphere® Application Server.

    For information about how to enable trace logging, see [Enabling traces in WebSphere Application Server](ts_t_enable_was_traces.md).

3.  Check the log files for information relating to events.

    Log entries relating to the user life-cycle commands that are sent from Profiles to the other applications are identified with the prefix, `com.ibm.lconn.events.*`.

    When a user is updated, a message is sent over the event infrastructure to other applications, and the log looks similar to the following.

    ```

    ```
    ProfilesService.updateUser("ajones141@example.com", displayName="Updated Sample Name")
