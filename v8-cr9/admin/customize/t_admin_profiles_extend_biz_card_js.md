# Adding third-party links using JavaScript {#t_admin_profiles_extend_biz_card_js .task}

Add third-party links to the Profiles business card using JavaScriptâ„¢.

In addition to defining services in the LotusConnections-config.xml file, you can include additional services in the Profiles business card using JavaScript. Your code can add a service either using a widget from another vendor or if your vendor-acquired application includes the business card as part of the application. These services do not need to be defined in the LotusConnections-config.xml configuration file.

To extend the Profiles business card using JavaScript, see [Integrating the Profiles business card](t_admin_profiles_include_biz_card.md).

**Note:** If you added third-party links to the Profiles business card and those links are no longer needed, you can remove them by modifying the LotusConnections-config.xml configuration file to undo or comment out what was done to add them. You cannot remove third-party links using JavaScript.
