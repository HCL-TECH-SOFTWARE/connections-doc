# Customizing the Profiles user interface {#t_profiles_customizing_attributes .task}

Specify which attributes should display in Profiles based on the needs of your organization.

In prior releases, customizing attributes for Profiles user interface display was done using the profiles-config.xml file. That customization is now done using a set of supplied template files and the FreeMarker Templating Language \(FTL\). This method provides greater customization flexibility.

Use the information in this section to customize your user interface templates.
