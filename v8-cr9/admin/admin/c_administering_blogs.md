# Administering Blogs {#c_administering_blogs .concept}

Administer site-wide settings for Blogs from either the Blogs user interface or via the wsadmin client.

You can make site-wide changes to Blogs from the Administration link in the Blogs user interface, or via commands using the wsadmin client. Unlike other HCL Connections applications, Blogs does not use an XML file to store configuration settings. Blogs configuration information is stored in, and accessed from, the Blogs application database. As a result, a configuration change is reflected in real time, and does not require a restart of the Blogs server.
