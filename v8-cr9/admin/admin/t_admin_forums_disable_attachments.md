# Disabling attachments {#t_admin_forums_disable_attachments .task}

Edit configuration property settings to prevent users from uploading file attachments to forums.

To run administrative commands, you must use the wsadmin client. For more information, see [Starting the wsadmin client](t_admin_wsadmin_starting.md).

By default, users can upload file attachments to forum topics, however you can disable this functionality by configuring a setting in the forum-config.xml file. If users have already uploaded file attachments to the Forums application and you subsequently disable this capability, the attachments are no longer visible in the user interface. The user interface options for adding and working with attachments are also hidden.

1.  To disable the upload of file attachments in Forums, complete the following steps.
2.  Start the wsadmin client from the following directory on the system where you installed the Deployment Manager:

    ```
    [app\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/profiles/dm\_profile\_root/bin
    ```

    where dm\_profile\_root is the Deployment Manager profile directory, typically dmgr01.

    You must start the client from this directory or else subsequent commands that you enter might fail.

3.  Start the Forums Jython script interpreter.

    1.  Use the following command to access the Forums configuration file:

        ```
        execfile("forumsAdmin.py")
        ```

        If you are prompted to specify a service to connect to, enter 1 to select the first node in the list. Most commands can run on any node. If the command specifies a file by using a local file path, select the node where the file is stored.

    2.  Check out the Forums configuration files by using the following command:

        ForumsConfigService.checkOutConfig\("working\_directory", "cell\_name"\)

        where:

        -   working\_directory is the temporary working directory to which the XML and XSD configuration files are copied. The files are kept in this working directory while you modify them.

            **Note:** Linux only: The directory must grant write permissions or the command fails.

        -   cell\_name is the name of the WebSphereÂ® Application Server cell that hosts the HCL Connections applications. This argument is required. It is also case-sensitive, so type it with care. If you do not know the cell name, you can determine it by typing the following command in the wsadmin command processor:

            print AdminControl.getCell\(\)

        For example:

        ForumsConfigService.checkOutConfig\("/opt/my\_temp\_dir", "ForumServerNode01Cell"\)

4.  Open the forum-config.xml file using a text editor.

5.  Change the value specified for the <allow-upload\> property from true to false as follows:

    ```
    <allow-upload>false</allow-upload>
    ```

6.  Save your changes and close the forum-config.xml file.

7.  After making changes, you must check the configuration files back in, and you must do so during the same wsadmin session in which you checked them out for the changes to take effect. See *Applying property changes* for information about how to save and apply your changes.
