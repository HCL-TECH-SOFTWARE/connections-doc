# Managing users when the Profiles application is not installed {#c_admin_common_user_life_cycle_without_profiles .concept}

If the Profiles application is not installed, you must manage changes to user status and data in each application database independently. The only way to update user data in the databases for the other applications is through a set of administrative synchronization commands.

These commands can also be used on HCL Connections deployments that do have Profiles installed to resolve situations where an application's membership database table needs to be corrected.

Synchronize user data between the HCL Connections application membership tables and the configured directory for the deployment.
