# Disabling widgets {#t_admin_homepage_disable_widgets .task}

You can disable widgets from displaying on the Home page or elsewhere in HCL Connections when you no longer want them to be available to your users.

Setting a widget's status to disabled means that it no longer displays on the Home page. The Home page administration user interface lists the current status of widgets in the widget catalog, and allows the administrator to enable and disable widgets as needed. All changes made in the user interface, including enabling and disabling widgets, take immediate effect without the need for application restart.

1.  To change a widget's status to disabled, complete the following steps.
2.  Open the Administration view.

3.  In the **Enabled apps** area, select the widget that you want to disable and click **Disable**.
