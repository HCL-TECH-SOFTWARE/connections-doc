# Using the My Communities app {#t_hp_using_my_communities_widget .task}

Use the My Communities app to retrieve the latest updates for the communities of which you are a member.

The My Communities app displays information about your communities that have been recently updated. You can view who last updated the community and when. The app also contains links to the feeds, bookmarks, and forum topics associated with each community. The list is ordered by the most recently updated community.

-   You can work with the My Communities app in the following ways:
-   To view a recently updated community, click the community title. The community opens in the Communities app, where you can view a summary of the latest updates on the Overview page.

-   If no communities display, click **Go to your Communities page** to open the Communities app and create a new community or join existing communities.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
