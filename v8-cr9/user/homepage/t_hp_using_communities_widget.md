# Using the Communities app {#t_hp_using_communities_widget .task}

Use the Communities app to access the latest updates to communities.

The Communities app displays information about the most recent entries to communities. The app contains links to the feeds, bookmarks, and forum topics associated with a community. Depending on the view you select, you can see updates for public communities or communities of which you are a member. The list is ordered by the most recently published entry.

-   You can work with the Communities app in the following ways:
-   To change views, click the Down arrow under the app title and select one of the following options:

    |View|Description|
    |----|-----------|
    |My Communities|In this view, the Communities app displays the most recently updated communities to which you belong.|
    |My Organization Communities|The My Organization Communities view displays the public communities that have been updated most recently.|

-   To view a community update, click a community title. The update opens in the Communities app.

-   If no communities display, click the link provided to open the Communities app and create a new community or join existing communities.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
