# Liking an entry {#concept_ey5_bc3_my .concept}

Let the author know that you liked a particular blog entry and recommend it to others. Liking an entry gives that entry more relative importance when the entries are sorted by using the **Likes/Votes** option on the **Public Blogs** page.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Blogs** and select the entry that you want to recommend to others.
2.  Click **Like** next to the like icon ![Like icon](../communities/images/like.png). Your like will be visible to others.

To view all entries that you've liked, click the **Public Blogs** tab then **My Likes/Votes** in the side panel.
