Activities have a few features that you might need a little help finding. Explore your preexisting activities in unexpected ways by trying these tips.

-   **[Updating membership](../activities/c_membership.md)**  
Teams change, and your organization must reflect those changes. Whether you're shifting roles or changing membership, Activities has you covered.
-   **[Prioritizing activities](../activities/c_prioritize_activity.md)**  
Got an important activity? More important than the others? Prioritize them.
-   **[Copying an activity](../activities/c_copy_activity.md)**  
Have an activity that you want to reuse, but not often enough to warrant a template? Copy it, and you'll be added as the new owner of an exact replica.
-   **[Creating and editing a template](../activities/c_using_templates.md)**  
Find yourself creating the same activity over and over? Never again. Build a reusable template to save your formatting and membership for later.
-   **[Linking to a single entry](../activities/c_get_web_link_for_entry.md)**  
Have a favorite entry that you want to save or share? Open an entry as its own web page so you can capture the link.
-   **[Saving an activity as a spreadsheet](../activities/c_save_activity_as_csv.md)**  
Need your activity as a spreadsheet? No problem. You can move your content into a spreadsheet by saving the activity as a Comma Separated Values \(CSV\) file.
