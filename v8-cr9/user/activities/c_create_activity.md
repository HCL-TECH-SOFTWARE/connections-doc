# Creating an activity {#concept_wgr_2ph_vx .concept}

The first step of any activity is its creation. You can start from scratch, copy an existing one, or reuse a template.

## Start a brand new activity { .section}

1.  In the menu bar, click **Apps** \> **Activities**.
2.  Click **Start an Activity**.
3.  Enter an activity name.
4.  Add a **Tag** to make finding the content easier in the future.
5.  Search and add a member and their role. You may also opt to do this later.
6.  Add an **Activity Goal** and **Due date**.
7.  You can also choose an existing activity **Template**.
8.  Click **Save**.

## Copy an existing activity { .section}

Have an activity that you want to reuse, but not often enough to warrant a template? Copy it for a single use.

1.  Open the activity.
2.  Click **Activity Actions**, and then click **Copy Activity**.
3.  Keep, change, or delete the content.

## Save an existing activity as a template { .section}

Found an activity that you just love? Save it as a template, then reuse it as many times as you need.

1.  Open the activity.
2.  Click **Activity Actions** \> **Copy as New Template**.

## Next steps { .section}

Now that you've laid out the skeleton, it's time to put some meat on those bones. Try [adding some to-dos](c_adding_a_todo.md) next.
