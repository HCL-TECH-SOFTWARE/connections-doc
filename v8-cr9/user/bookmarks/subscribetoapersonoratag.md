# Adding bookmarks to your watchlist {#subscribetoapersonoratag .task}

The watchlist maintains a list of the most recent bookmarks that match criteria you specify. You can add bookmarks to your watchlist that are associated with a person, with a tag, or both.

## About this task

Click the **My Updates** tab to view an up-to-date collection of these bookmarks.

## Procedure

You can add bookmarks to your watchlist in three different ways:

    -   To add a person to your watchlist, display the person's bookmarks and click **Add to Watchlist** in the bookmark status bar.
    -   To add bookmarks associated with a tag to your watchlist, filter the bookmarks list according to a tag by viewing **Public Bookmarks** and clicking a tag. Click **Add to Watchlist** in the bookmark status bar.
    -   To add bookmarks created by a specific person and marked with a particular tag, display the person's bookmarks and click a tag in the tag cloud or a tag displayed in the bookmarks list. Click **Add to Watchlist** in the bookmark status bar.

**Note:** The **My Updates** view shows bookmarks from a certain period of time, such as the last two weeks. The time period can be configured by the administrator. If your watchlist does not include any recent bookmarks for a person or tag you specified, it is possible that there are not any new bookmarks for that time period.
