# Configuring a Highlights widget {#c_com_config_highlights_widget .concept}

Community owners can configure the widgets on the Highlights page to include content from multiple sources.

The widgets on a Highlights page can display content not only from the community apps, but also from other communities or sources. For example, you can configure a blog to display the posts from the community blog plus posts from a related blog in another community. Similarly, you can combine content from multiple forums or wikis. Think of it like assembling a content feed.

To configure a widget, choose **Edit** from the widget menu. Note that from this menu you can also remove the widget from the Highlights page.

One common configuration change you can make to widgets that support aggregation is to change or add the content source.

For example, to configure a Files widget to include files from another community:

1.  Click **Edit** from the widget menu \(ellipsis\).
2.  In the side pane under **Files settings**, expand the **Content sources** section.

    **Note:** At this time you cannot configure widgets to display personalized information, where the logged-in user sees content specific to them, for example the "My Files" widget.

3.  Under **Channel 1**, the containing community is identified as the source, or channel, for files. You can overwrite that community or add a new channel to bring in files from a community in addition to the containing community. Start typing a community name to see matching results.
4.  Pick a community. The image beside the configuration pane is a preview of how the widget will look, and updates on the fly. You can also edit the channel name and change how much to show in the widget. When the you're satisfied with the preview, save the changes.
5.  When you return to the Highlights page, files from the community you specified will display in the Files widget.
