# Creating a wiki page {#t_com_create_wiki_page .concept}

With Editor access, you can create a wiki page and add content to it so you can share information with community members.

**Note:** For information on wiki roles, see [Assigning app roles for community members](managing_roles_for_community_members.md).

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to contribute to.
2.  In the community **Highlights** page, in the **Wiki** area, click **Create a Wiki Page**. Alternatively, click **Wiki** in the community menu then **New Page** in the sidebar.
3.  Enter a name that describes the content of the wiki page.
4.  You can add a variety of content types to the page, for example:

    -   To layout and format your content, use the extensive formatting options, such as **Paragraph Format**, **Font Names**, and **Font Sizes**.
    -   To attach an image to the page, use **Insert/Edit Image**.
    Learn more about other content that you can add [using the rich text editor](../eucommon/eucommon_ckeditor.md).
