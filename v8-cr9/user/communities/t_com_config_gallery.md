# Configuring a gallery to display files and folders {#t_com_config_gallery .task}

The Gallery app allows you to showcase files of any type, such as photos, videos, and office files, on the community Highlights page. When configured, the Gallery is renamed with the folder or community name and displays thumbnail images for the files. You can have multiple galleries in a community.

Configure the Gallery to display content from community folders.

**Note:** You cannot upload files to a community gallery. Instead, you upload files and add files to community folders using the Files app and then use a gallery to view these files. For information on community files and folders, see [Organizing content in community files](community_files_manage_frame.md).

1.  To configure a gallery:
2.  Add the **Gallery** app to your community's Highlights page. For more information, see [Adding apps and widgets to the Highlights page](c_com_highlights_widgets.md).

3.  On the community **Highlights** page, in the **Gallery** area, click **Set up the Gallery**.

4.  Do one of the following actions:

    -   To configure the gallery to display all community files, select **All Community Files**.
    -   To configure the gallery to display files from a single folder, select that folder.

        **Note:** The folders that are listed include community folders and folders that are shared with the community.

5.  Click **Set As Gallery**.


A thumbnail image is displayed for each file. If a thumbnail is not available a file type icon appears. Click any thumbnail to open the file page.
