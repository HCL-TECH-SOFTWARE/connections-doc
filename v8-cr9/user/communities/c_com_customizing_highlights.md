# Customizing the Highlights page {#c_com_customizing_highlights .concept}

As a community owner, you can customize Highlights, the default start page for a new community, to create a portal-like experience where you can aggregate content from a variety of sources, as well as display standard community apps.

For example, you might include a news feed that brings in posts from a couple of key blogs that everyone in your community can see. You can make a community a one-stop experience for your user, where they can find the content that they need to collaborate with the team on one page. At the same time, you can include any standard apps from your community.

**Attention:** To customize the Highlights page you should be comfortable configuring widgets. For an example of how you do it, see [Configuring a Highlights widget](c_com_config_highlights_widget.md).
