# Creating a forum {#t_forums_add_forum .task}

Start a new forum when you want to solicit answers to a specific question or to discuss particular topic.

When you create a forum, you automatically become the owner of that forum. If content moderation is enabled in your deployment, you also become the forum moderator. Note that some organizations allow only designated people to create forums.

**Note:** A forum that you create in the Forums application is public by default. Any user in your organization with access to the Forums application can view and contribute to public forums. To create a forum with restricted access, you must create the forum inside a community with restricted access.

1.  To create a stand-alone forum, complete the following steps.
2.  From the Public Forums page, click **Start a Forum**.

    You can also create a forum from the **Forums** tab on the My Forums page.

3.  To categorize the forum and make it easier to find, enter one or more tags in the **Tags** field.

4.  Click **Save**.


Click **Start a Topic** to add topics to your new forum. If you do not want to create topics now, you can access the forum later from the My Forums page.
