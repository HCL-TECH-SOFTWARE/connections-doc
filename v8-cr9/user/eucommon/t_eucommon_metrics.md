# Viewing metrics {#concept_gmj_qtt_gy .concept}

Use metrics to view a table or chart that shows how people are using HCL Connections.

## What metrics can you view? { .section}

Connections collects metrics on global and community levels. Global metrics report on overall usage, while community metrics only report on a specific community. Administrators assign access levels to users based on their role within the organization. Community owners can only view community reports, while business owners can view community reports and global reports if given access. Administrators can view both types of reports.
