# Connecting with external users {#whatcanidoasanexternaluser .concept}

Learn what an external user can do in HCL Connections, and how you can invite them to register.

External users, indicated by the ![External user icon](ext_user.jpg) icon, can use many Connections features. A person becomes an external user when:

-   Someone in an organization invites them to join Connections as a guest.
-   Someone in an organization invites them to join a Connections community and they accept the invitation.
-   Someone in an organization shares a file with them.

## Inviting a guest { .section}

Once your administrator assigns you to the appropriate role, you can collaborate with people who are not members of Connections by inviting them to register as guests. Guest accounts are free; no extra fees are charged to your organization or to the guests.

To invite one or more guests using a web client:

1.  Click **Invite Guest** and do one of the following:
    -   Enter the name and email address of the person to invite. You can also personalize the invitation message.
    -   To invite multiple guests at once, click the **Import CSV** tab and click **Select file**. The entries in the file must have the following format: email address,Given name,Surname

        **Note:** To import CSV files, you must first be assigned the Connections admin role.

2.  Click **Send Invitation**. The person receives an email invitation that directs them to the registration web page, and then to the Connections login screen.
3.  Optionally, click **Invite Another** to continue inviting more guests.

To invite one or more guests using the mobile app:
