# Giving apps access to your data {#givingapplicationsaccesstoyourconnectionsdata .concept}

Give apps access to your Connections information and allow them to post information to Connections.

Your administrator must register the apps that are allowed to ask for permission to use your data.

When you open a registered app, you can decide whether you want to give the app access to your data. If you give permission, the app can use your data or push data to Connections. Access is given to all content that you create in Connections. For example, the app can use your profile photograph and personal information, as well as your files, comments, bookmarks, and blog entries. It could also post information to your Connections home page status.

To remove permissions from apps:

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Profile** then **Settings**.
2.  Click **Application Access** in the side panel.
3.  In the list of authorized apps, click **Remove** to remove permission.
