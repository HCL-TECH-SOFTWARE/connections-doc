# Suspending or stopping sync {#ms_desktop_plugins_filesync_suspend .task}

You can suspend sync temporarily, turn off syncing for My Drive, or disconnect from a site altogether.

You may want to turn off syncing temporarily, for example, if you are making a lot of changes to files and want to sync when the changes are complete. Or, you might want to disconnect from a site if your work on a project is complete and you no longer want to maintain file syncing.

-   To suspend sync activities temporarily, right-click the My Drive folder and choose **HCL Connections** \> **Suspend sync**.

-   To turn off syncing for a local sync folder, right-click the My Drive folder and choose **HCL Connections** \> **Stop using sync**. If you turn off sync, the contents of the sync folder is copied into another folder and syncing is turned off. You can create a new sync folder at a later time to resume syncing for that site.

-   To turn off syncing by disconnecting from the server, right-click the server name in the IBM Connections section, and choose **Disconnect from this site**. Disconnecting does not delete any content. The contents of the associated My Drive folder are copied to a new folder and the server and all sub-folders are removed from your HCL Connections folder.

-   To stop syncing a file or folder you can also remove it from My Drive. Note that removing a file or folder from My Drive does not delete the file or folder. Also, if a file is in more than one location in My Drive, for example if you add the file to My Drive and then later add a folder containing the file to My Drive, you must remove all of the instances of the file from My Drive to turn off syncing for the file.
