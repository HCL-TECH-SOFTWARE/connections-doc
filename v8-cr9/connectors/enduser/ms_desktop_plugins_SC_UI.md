# Managing synced files from the Files application {#ms_desktop_plugins_SC_UI .concept}

When file sync is enabled for your Connections deployment, you can view and manage files that you added locally to your My Drive folder from the My Drive folder in the Files application. Or, you can add files from the Files application to My Drive and be able to access them from your local My Drive folder.

When sync is enabled for an organization and you have installed this plug-in, the contents of your local My Drive folder are available from My Drive in the Connections Files app as well. You can manage and edit file from either repository and know that you always have the latest version of the content.
