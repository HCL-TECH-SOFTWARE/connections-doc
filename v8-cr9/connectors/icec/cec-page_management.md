If you click on the edit icon, a dialog will open. Here you can rename the page's name, title, add or remove content editors and select a custom layout. Renaming a page to a name already taken will rename the original page by adding the suffix **-old**.

Note: Homepage personalization and Flyout Page will not be interfered by the renaming. Target of both will still be the **old** Connections Engagement Center page.
