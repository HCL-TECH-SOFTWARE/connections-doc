# Enabling SPNEGO single sign-on for SiteMinder {#t_secure_with_siteminder .task}

Configure HCL Connections™ to use single sign-on with Computer Associates' SiteMinder and SPNEGO.

Before you can enable SSO, you must first install Connections and ensure that you can access the installed applications from a web browser. You must also have completed the TAI/ASA installation and configuration instructions that are included with SiteMinder, including registering the TAI/ASA with WebSphere® Application Server.

-   Complete the task described in the [Configuring web browsers to support SPNEGO](t_install_kerb_edit_browsers.md) topic.
-   Verify that you can access Connections applications from a web browser.

**Notes:**

-   Each href attribute in the LotusConnections-config.xml file is case-sensitive and must specify a fully-qualified domain name.

-   The connectionsAdmin J2C alias that you specified during installation must correspond to a valid account that can authenticate with SiteMinder. It may map to a back-end administrative user account. This account must be capable of authenticating for single sign-on against SiteMinder. If you need to update the user ID or credentials for this alias, see the [Changing references to administrative credentials](../admin/t_admin_common_changing_admin_passwords.md) topic.
-   WebSphere Application Server 7 does not provide the key Java™ libraries that you need to install and configure SiteMinder Application Server Agents \(ASA\) for WebSphere with WebSphere Application Server. The procedure to update your files is described in Step 1 of this task.
-   For more information about the SiteMinder Policy Server and Web Agent configuration, go to the [CA SiteMinder BookShelf](https://support.ca.com/cadocs/0/CA%20SiteMinder%2012%2051-ENU/Bookshelf.html).
-   For more information about the SiteMinder Agent for WebSphere, see the [CA SiteMinder Agent for WebSphere guide](https://support.ca.com/cadocs/0/CA%20SiteMinder%20Agent%20for%20WebSphere%20r12%20SP2-ENU/Bookshelf_Files/PDF/SMWebSphereAgent_conf_enu.pdf) \(PDF\) and the [CA eTrust SiteMinder Agent for IBM® WebSphere Release Notes®](https://support.ca.com/cadocs/0/CA%20SiteMinder%20Agent%20for%20WebSphere%20r12%20SP2-ENU/Bookshelf_Files/PDF/SMWebSphereAgent_rel_enu.pdf) \(PDF\). The latest Application Server Agent \(ASA\) at the moment is version 12. CA support confirms that it can be used with SM 12.51.

This task describes how to create SiteMinder Agent and Domain objects with realms, rules, and a policy that is related to HTTP Server, Microsoft™ Internet Information Services \(IIS\), and WebSphere Application Server.

When a user requests a page that is protected by SiteMinder, the Web Agent on the HTTP server intercepts the request and prompts the user for authentication. The user is redirected to a Microsoft IIS server which is configured for SPNEGO authentication. If the user provides valid credentials, the user is authenticated by SPNEGO and a SiteMinder agent on the IIS server generates an SMSESSION cookie. This cookie is added to the request which is passed on to WebSphere Application Server. The SiteMinder Trust Association Interceptor \(TAI\) on the application server verifies the information in the cookie and sets the User Principal that Connections requires to identify the user.

This task refers to a configuration that uses SiteMinder Policy Server 6.0 SP5, SiteMinder ASA 6.0 Agent for WebSphere Application Server \(with CR00010 hotfix\), and SiteMinder Web Agent v6qmr5-cr035.

To set up SSO using SiteMinder with SPNEGO, complete the following steps:

1.  Download and apply the Unrestricted JCE policy files:

    1.  Go to the [J2SE 5 SDK Security information](https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=jcesdk) web page.

    2.  Authenticate with your universal HCL user ID and password.

    3.  Download the **Unrestricted JCE Policy files for SDK for all newer versions** package.

    4.  Extract the files from the downloaded package.

    5.  Back up your existing copies \(if any\) of the US\_export\_policy.jar and local\_policy.jar files, located in the [app\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/java/jre/lib/security directory.

    6.  Copy the new jar files from the extracted package to the same directory, overwriting any existing files.

2.  Create agents on the SiteMinder Policy Server, including Web Agents for HTTP Server and Microsoft IIS, and an Application Server Agent for WebSphere Application Server.

    1.  Open the SiteMinder Administration console.

    2.  Right-click **Agents** and select **Create Agent**.

    3.  Enter details of the **Name** and **Description** of the Web Agent for HTTP Server.

    4.  Repeat these steps for the Web Agent for IIS.

    5.  Repeat these steps for the Application Server Agent.

3.  Create Agent Configuration Objects on the SiteMinder Policy Server. In the SiteMinder Administration Console, open the Agent Conf Objects pane and complete the following steps:

    1.  Configure the Web Agent for HTTP Server:

        1.  Right-click **Apache Default Settings Agent**and select **Duplicate Configuration Object**.
        2.  Enter the **Name** and **description** of the Agent Configuration Object.
        3.  Update the following parameters to match your environment:

            DefaultAgentName
            :   Name of the Apache Agent created earlier

            CookieDomain
            :   your\_domain

                where your\_domain is your Connections domain. If, for example, the URL is http://activities.example.com/activities, your host name is activities.example.com and your domain is example.com. In this example, you would set CookieDomain=example.com. .

            RequireCookies
            :   NO

                This parameter configures the Web Agent to support basic authentication but without requiring all API client programs to support cookies.

            BadCSSChars
            :   <,\>

                This parameter enables the *Invite colleagues* functionality in Profiles.

            LogOffUri
            :   URI

                Configure SiteMinder to recognize only one web address as the logout web address. Uncomment one of the following URIs by removing the number sign \(\#\) character:

                \#LogOffUri="/activities/service/html/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/blogs/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/communities/communities/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/dogear/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/files/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/forums/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/homepage/web/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/moderation/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/news/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/profiles/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/search/ibm\_security\_logout"

                \#LogOffUri="/wikis/ibm\_security\_logout"

    2.  While In the SiteMinder Administration Console, set the IgnoreHost parameter either as HTTPS: IgnoreHost="connections.example.com:444" or HTTP:IgnoreHost="connections.example.com:8888" on both the Siteminder Policy server and on the Connections server. If this setting is not the same on both servers, connectivity will fail.

    3.  Under the System tab, update the **Agent Configuration Object** with the following value: FCCCompatMode - NO

    4.  Configure the Web Agent for IIS:

        1.  Right-click **IIS Default Settings Agent**and select **Duplicate Configuration Object**.
        2.  Enter the **Name** and **description** of the Agent Configuration Object.
        3.  Update the following parameters to match your environment:

            DefaultAgentName
            :   Name of the Apache Agent created earlier

            CookieDomain
            :   your\_domain

                where your\_domain is your Connections domain. If, for example, the URL is http://activities.example.com/activities, your host name is activities.example.com and your domain is example.com. In this example, you would set CookieDomain=example.com. .

            RequireCookies
            :   NO

                This parameter configures the Web Agent to support basic authentication but without requiring all API client programs to support cookies.

            BadCSSChars
            :   <,\>

                This parameter enables the *Invite colleagues* functionality in Profiles.

    5.  Configure the Application Server Agent:

        1.  Right-click **Apache Default Settings Agent**and select **Duplicate Configuration Object**.
        2.  Enter the **Name** and **description** of the Agent Configuration Object.
        3.  Update the following parameters to match your environment:

            DefaultAgentName
            :   Name of the Apache Agent created earlier

            CookieDomain
            :   your\_domain

                where your\_domain is your Connections domain. If, for example, the URL is http://activities.example.com/activities, your host name is activities.example.com and your domain is example.com. In this example, you would set CookieDomain=example.com.

            AssertionAuthResource
            :   /siteminderassertion

            AssertbyUserID
            :   True

        4.  Check whether the **PrevalidateCookie** property exists in the Configuration Values as follows:
            -   If **PrevalidateCookie** does exist, click **Edit** and set it to YES.
            -   If **PrevalidateCookie** does not exist, click **Add**, add a parameter named **PrevalidateCookie**, and set it to YES.
            -   Click **OK** and then click **OK** again to save the parameters.
    **Notes:**

    -   When activated, the LogOffUri parameter clears the SMSESSION cookie and ensures that the user is logged out of all Connections browser sessions.
    -   To add parameters, edit the Agent Configuration Object on the SiteMinder Policy Server. Alternatively, you can edit the LocalConfig.conf file on the HTTP server if the Web Agent is configured to use it.
    -   If you are editing the SiteMinder configuration file directly, you must surround the values of SiteMinder configuration parameters with quotation marks \("\); for example: BadCSSChars="<,\>". If you are changing these parameters within the SiteMinder Policy Server, do not use quotation marks.
4.  Specify your SiteMinder Authentication Scheme configuration:

    1.  Open the SiteMinder Administration Console and navigate to the **Authentication Scheme Properties** dialog box.

    2.  From the **Authentication Scheme type** list, select **Windows Authentication template**.

    3.  Clear the **Use Relative Target** check box.

    4.  Enter the URL of your IIS server in the **web Server Name** field.

    5.  Complete the **User DN Lookup** field with the appropriate information for your domain. For example, \(sAMAccountName=%\{UID\}\).

5.  On the SiteMinder Policy Server, create a domain for the HTTP Server web agent.

6.  Create protected realms under the HTTP Server Web Agent domain:

    1.  Using the HTTP Server Agent Object and Windows Authentication Scheme that you created earlier, create SiteMinder realms that are protected by Windows forms authentication.

    3.  Protect login credentials with encryption: Using the **Basic over SSL Template** scheme, create a SiteMinder Authentication Scheme and apply the new Authentication Scheme to all the SiteMinder realms that require basic authentication.

7.  Create Delete and Head actions for the Web Agent. By default, the Web Agent has only the Get, Post, and Put actions available. To add the Delete and Head actions, complete the following steps:

    1.  In the SiteMinder Administration Console, click **View** and select **Agent Types**.

    2.  Select **Agent Types** in the Systems pane.

    3.  Double-click **Web Agent** in the Agent Type list.

    4.  In the Agent Type Properties dialog box, click **Create**.

    5.  Enter Delete in the New Agent Action dialog box and click **OK**.

    6.  Enter Head in the New Agent Action dialog box and click **OK**.

    7.  Click **OK** again to save the new action.

8.  Create the following rules for each realm:

    |GetPostPutDelHead rule|OnAuthAccept rule|
    |----------------------|-----------------|
    |Realm: CurrentRealm|Realm: CurrentRealm|
    |Resource: \* \(not /\*\)|Resource: \* \(not /\*\)|
    |Action: Web Agent actions -\> Get,Post,Put,Delete,Head|Action: Authentication events -\> OnAuthAccept|
    |When this Rule fires: Allow Access|When this Rule fires: Allow Access|
    |Enable or Disable this Rule: Enabled|Enable or Disable this Rule: Enabled|

9.  Create a policy and add the users who will be able to access the server to the policy. You can allow all users in the LDAP directory or a subset of users; for example: an LDAP branch, individual users, or groups of users.

10. Add the new rules to the new policy.

11. Specify realms that are not protected by SiteMinder.

    **Note:** You must configure notification templates and some Atom feeds as unprotected URLs. The Blogs footer page must also be unprotected because Blogs uses the Velocity template to extract footer pages.

12. On the SiteMinder Policy Server, create a domain for the Application Server Agent.

13. Add the following realm to the new WebSphere Application Server domain:

    |Realm name|Protected resource|
    |----------|------------------|
    |SM TAI Validation|/siteminderassertion|

    **Note:** You must configure the Protected Resource of this realm to match the AssertionAuthResource parameter that you configured earlier for the Application Server Agent.

    **Note:** Make sure that SM TAI honors SM session-based cookies and the triggered LTPA cookies to be generated by WAS.

14. On the SiteMinder Policy Server, create a domain for the IIS Server Agent.

15. Using the IIS Agent Object and Windows Authentication Scheme that you created earlier, create a SiteMinder realm that is protected by Windows authentication.

    |Realm name|Protected resource|
    |----------|------------------|
    |IIS\_Realm|/|

16. Create the following rules for this realm:

    |GetPostPutDelHead rule|OnAuthAccept rule|
    |----------------------|-----------------|
    |Realm: CurrentRealm|Realm: CurrentRealm|
    |Resource: \* \(not /\*\)|Resource: \* \(not /\*\)|
    |Action: Web Agent actions -\> Get,Post,Put,Delete,Head|Action: Authentication events -\> OnAuthAccept|
    |When this Rule fires: Allow Access|When this Rule fires: Allow Access|
    |Enable or Disable this Rule: Enabled|Enable or Disable this Rule: Enabled|

17. Set the timeout value of the session for each realm.

    1.  In the SiteMinder Policy Server, open the **Realm Dialog** and click **Session**.

    2.  In the Session Timeouts Group Box, enter timeouts for each realm. Enter the following values, if they are not already present:

        Maximum Timeout Enabled
        :   2 Hours 0 Minutes

        Idle Timeout Enabled
        :   1 Hours 0 Minutes

    **Note:** The maximum timeout and the idle timeout must be longer than the LTPA token timeout, which is defined in WebSphere Application Server. The LTPA token timeout is set to 120 minutes by default.

18. Install the Web Agent on HTTP Server:

    3.  When you are prompted for the Agent Configuration details, specify the Agent Configuration Object that you created earlier.

21. Copy the smagent.properties file from the ASA installation conf folder to the WebSphere Application Server profile properties folder; for example: C:\\program files\\IBM\\websphere\\appserver\\profiles\\appsvr01\\properties.

22. Configure Trust Association Interceptor on WebSphere Application Server.

    1.  From the administrative console for WebSphere Application Server, click **Security** \> **Global security**.

    2.  Under Web and SIP security, click **Trust association**.

    3.  Click **Enable Trust Association** and then click **Save**.

    4.  Click **Interceptors**.

    5.  Delete any unused interceptors.

        **Note:** Do not delete the OAuth interceptor.

    6.  Click **New** and enter the following name for the new interceptor:

        com.netegrity.siteminder.websphere.auth.SmTrustAssociationInterceptor

    7.  Add the following custom property under **Global Security** \> **Custom properties**: `com.ibm.websphere.security.performTAIForUnprotectedURI=true`.

    8.  Click **OK** and then click **Save**.

        **Note:** Connections servers should be protected by both SM TAI and OAuth TAI. This is important for supporting the EE and Activities Stream features.

    9.  Restart WebSphere Application Server.

23. Create rewrite rules that redirect URLs when users log out of Connections. Add the following rules to the httpd.conf file:

    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteCond %\{REQUEST\_URI\} /\(.\*\)/ibm\_security\_logout\(.\*\)

    RewriteCond %\{QUERY\_STRING\} !=logoutExitPage=your\_logout\_url

    RewriteRule /\(.\*\)/ibm\_security\_logout\(.\*\)

    LogOffUri?logoutExitPage=your\_logout\_url \[noescape,L,R\]

    where LogOffUri is the URL that you uncommented earlier. After logging out of Connections, the user's browser is directed to your\_logout\_url. This URL could be your corporate home page or the SiteMinder login page.

    **Note:** You must add these rules to both the HTTP and HTTPS entries.

    The following example illustrates a typical portion of the httpd.conf file after you have implemented this step:

    ```
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /(.*)/ibm_security_logout(.*)
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !=logoutExitPage=http://corphome.example.com
    RewriteRule /(.*)/ibm_security_logout(.*)  /homepage/web/ibm_security_logout?logoutExitPage=http://corphome.example.com [noescape,L,R]
    
    
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/feed/blogs/atom(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/feed/$1/blogs/atom/ [R,L]
    
    #Connections Config for SSL
    LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so
    <IfModule mod_ibm_ssl.c>
    Listen 0.0.0.0:443
    <VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName connections.example.com
    SSLEnable
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /(.*)/ibm_security_logout(.*)
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !=logoutExitPage=http://corphome.example.com
    RewriteRule /(.*)/ibm_security_logout(.*) /homepage/web/ibm_security_logout?logoutExitPage=http://corphome.example.com [noescape,L,R]
    
    
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/feed/blogs/atom(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/feed/$1/blogs/atom/ [R,L]
    
    </VirtualHost>
    </IfModule>
    SSLDisable
    ```

    **Note:** Uncomment the `LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so` line in the httpd.conf file. This line is commented out by default. When the line is commented out, the web server will not start.

24. For configurations with Connections 4.5 CR1 or later installed, remove the following rewrite rules:

    ```
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/api/(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/api/$1/api/$2 [R,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/feed/tags/atom(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/feed/$1/tags/atom/ [R,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/feed/entries/atom(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/feed/$1/entries/atom/ [R,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/feed/comments/atom(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/feed/$1/comments/atom/ [R,L]
    
    ```

    From the SSL and non-SSL sections of the http.conf file, remove the following rewrite rule::

    ```
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blogs/roller-ui/rendering/(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/blogs/(.*)/feed/blogs/atom(.*) /blogs/roller-ui/rendering/feed/$1/blogs/atom/ [R,L] 
    ```

25. Configure SiteMinder to use HTTP or HTTPS communications:

    1.  Add the following lines to the end of the httpd.conf file:

        -   HTTP:

            ```
            Listen 8888
            <VirtualHost *:8888>
            	ServerName connections.example.com
            </VirtualHost>
            ```

        -   HTTPS:

            ```
            Listen 444
            <VirtualHost *:444>
            	ServerName connections.example.com
            	SSLEnable
            	Keyfile "/opt/IBM/KeyFiles/webserver-key.kdb"
            	SSLStashFile "/opt/IBM/KeyFiles/webserver-key.sth"
            </VirtualHost>
            ```

            Save and close the file.

    2.  Open the WebAgent.conf file, usually located in the [ibm\_http\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/conf directory, and uncomment the LocalConfig.conf location: localconfigfile="/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/conf/LocalConfig.conf". Save and close the file.

    3.  Open the LocalConfig.conf file, usually located in the [ibm\_http\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/conf directory, and configure the IgnoreHost setting to ensure that SiteMinder ignores any traffic that goes through this virtual host.

        HTTPS: IgnoreHost="connections.example.com:444"

        HTTP:IgnoreHost="connections.example.com:8888"

    4.  Comment out every other line in the LocalConfig.conf file. Save and close the file.

    5.  Add the virtual host to WebSphere Application Server:

        1.  In the Integrated Solutions Console on the Deployment Manager, click **Environment** \> **Virtual Hosts** \> **default\_host** \> **Host Aliases** \> **New**.
        2.  Enter the host name and port of the alias. For example: enter \* and 444 for HTTPS, or \* and 8888 for HTTP.

            **Note:** Verify that HTTP Server copied the updated plugin-cfg.xml file to the [ibm\_http\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/Plugins/config/webserver1 directory. The timestamp on the file indicates when it was updated.

    6.  Add the interservice URL for the new virtual host to the LotusConnections-config.xml file:

        1.  Check out the LotusConnections-config.xml file. For information about editing configuration files, see the [Changing common configuration property values](../admin/t_admin_common_changing_config.md) topic.
        2.  Add 444 or 8888 to each instance of interService URL. For example, change <sloc:interService href="http://connections.example.com"/\> to <sloc:interService href="https://connections.example.com:444"/\>
        3.  Save and check in the file.
26. Check the LotusConnections-config.xml file to ensure that the custom authenticator already is set to DefaultAuthenticator. If the current configuration has been used previously as a Siteminder configuration but is being enabled for SPNEGO now, then you need to change the custom authenticator property to be DefaultAuthenticator by editing the LotusConnections-config.xml file as follows:

    1.  Use the following command to check out the configuration file:

        -   execfile\("app\_server\_root/profiles/DMGR/bin/connectionsConfig.py"\)

            **Note:** If you are prompted to specify which server to connect to, enter 1.

            LCConfigService.checkOutConfig\("working\_directory","cell\_name"\)

        where:

        -   [app\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md) is the WebSphere Application Server installation directory
        -   DMGR is the name of the Deployment Manager profile. For example: Dmgr01
        -   working\_directory is the temporary working directory to which the configuration XML and XSD files are copied while you edit them. Use forward slashes to separate directories in the file path, even if you are using the Microsoft Windows operating system.
        -   cell\_name is the name of the WebSphere Application Server cell hosting the Connections application. This argument is case sensitive. If you do not know the cell name, execute the following command in the wsadmin client to determine it:
            -   print AdminControl.getCell\(\)

        For example:

        LCConfigService.checkOutConfig\("c:/temp","foo01Cell01"\)

    2.  Update the custom authenticator values by running the following commands:

        1.  Configure the custom authenticator to support server-to-server authentication for SiteMinder and SPNEGO:

            LCConfigService.updateConfig\("customAuthenticator.name",

            "DefaultAuthenticator"\)

        2.  Set the value of the custom.authenticator.cookieTimeout parameter to be equal to or less than the maximum timeout and idle timeout values that you configured [earlier](t_secure_with_siteminder.md#SetTheTimeoutValueOfTheSessionByCl). Specify the timeout value in minutes.

            LCConfigService.updateConfig\("customAuthenticator.CookieTimeout","timeout"

            where timeout is a value in minutes that is less than or equal to the SiteMinder timeout values.

        **Note:** When your production environment is ready, set the AllowSelfSignedCerts parameter to false.

    3.  Check the LotusConnections-config.xml file back in by running the following command:

        LCConfigService.checkInConfig\(\)

27. Restart HTTP Server, the Deployment Manager, and the nodes.

28. Files and wikis display the log in button in Siteminder and SPNEGO configuration even though the user is logged in. This occurs in public files and wikis pages as the server does not require user authentication for public pages. To solve this issue, you need to disable anonymous for wikis by mapping 'reader' to 'All authenticated in application's realm'. This change needs to be done for all SPNEGO-related configurations and not just Siteminder and SPNEGO configuration. To remove the log in string for both Files and Wikis on SPNEGO configurations, follow these steps:

    -   Log in to the WebSphere Application Server admin console.
    -   Go to **Applications** and click **Applications types**.
    -   Click **Websphere enterprise applications**, then click **Wikis/Files** in the list.
    -   When the page loads, click **User group mapping** in **Security role** pane.
    -   Tick box beside **Everyone**.
    -   Click **Map special subjects** in the drop-down menu, then click **All authenicated in application's realm**.
    -   Click **OK**, then click **Save**.

        **Note:** These steps need to be completed for Files and Wikis. Once the steps are done, restart the configuration to see the changes.


Verify that the configuration is working correctly:

1.  Log in to your Windows client system.
2.  Open Firefox or Internet Explorer and navigate to https://IHS\_host/homepage. If you can log in without entering your credentials, then you have successfully configured single sign-on for SiteMinder with SPNEGO.
