The appregistry extension enables sharing connections pages to Microsoft Teams through Share iconThe json from ms-teams-share-extension.json can either be imported from file or copied / pasted into the code editor of the appregistry client to create the extension.

When MS Teams is enabled within Share, users are given the option **MS Teams Share** upon clicking on the **Share** icon ![](images/c_install_share.png)
