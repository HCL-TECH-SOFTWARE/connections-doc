# Configuring SPNEGO for Customizer {#cp_config_customizer_spnego .task}

Configure a service principal name and keytab using HCL Connectionsâ„¢ Customizer in a SPEGO environment.

Configure the reverse proxy server for Customizer before beginning this task.

To configure Customizer in a SPNEGO environment, you must create a service principal name \(SPN\) and keytab for the new reverse proxy server, and then merge them into the existing configuration. For instructions on creating the SPN and keytab and then merging with the previous configuration, see [Creating a service principal name and keytab file](../secure/t_install_kerb_create_service_account.md).
