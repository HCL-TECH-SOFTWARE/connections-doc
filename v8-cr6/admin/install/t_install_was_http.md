# Installing IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM HTTP Server {#t_install_was_http .task}

HCL Connections requires an environment where the WebSphere® Application Server Deployment Manager and one node are installed and configured in advance. IBM® HTTP Server and the Web Server Plug-ins for IBM WebSphere Application Server are also prerequisites. This software is provided with the HCL Connections package.

-   **[Installing IBM WebSphere Application Server](../install/t_install_was.md)**  
To prepare for installing HCL Connections, install IBM WebSphere Application Server on the Deployment Manager and nodes, then configure them with the settings needed for Connections.
-   **[Defining IBM HTTP Server](../install/t_create_webserver1_node_b.md)**  
Define IBM HTTP Server to manage web connections. If you select to configure HTTP Server at the beginning of the Connections installation, you would perform this task at that point; otherwise you would perform this after installation completes.
