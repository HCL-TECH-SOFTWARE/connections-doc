# Install on Linux or Unix {#setup-editors-install-install-on-linux-unix-or-aix .task}

The installation of Tiny Editors for HCL Connections on Linux or Unix is automated using a shell script.

Before you begin:

-   Determine the host\_name of the server hosting HCL Connectionsâ„¢.
-   Get user access as the HCL Connections installer or higher administrative permissions, on both:
    -   The host server.
    -   The WebSphere Application Server Console.

1.  Determine the Connections paths \(customization\_path and provision\_path\).

    1.  Log in to the web interface of the WebSphere Application Server Console.

        The default address is: https://host\_name:9043/ibm/console

    2.  Expand **Environment** and click the **WebSphere variables** link.

    3.  Find the **CONNECTIONS\_CUSTOMIZATION\_PATH** in the variables list and record the value which will be referred to as customization\_path from this point.

    4.  Find the **CONNECTIONS\_PROVISION\_PATH** in the variables list and record the value which will be referred to as provision\_path from this point.

2.  **Attention:** We strongly recommend:

-   Setting up SSH key access to the Connections host server.
-   Using a local SSH agent to avoid password prompts when logging in via SSH.
The following script makes numerous connections, and connection prompts for a password if SSH keys are not used.

3.  Run the `install.sh` script located in the root directory of the Tiny Editors for HCL Connections package as follows:

    ```
    ./install.sh user@host\_name customization\_path provision\_path/webresources 
    ```

    CAUTION:

    Remember to append /webresources to the provision\_path in the above command.

    **Note:** This command will automatically backup any existing configuration it finds in

    -   customization\_path/javascript/tiny/editors/connections
    -   customization\_path/javascript/ephox/editors/connections
    -   customization\_path/javascript/ephox/editlive/connections
    If a backup of configurations is not required, run the install script with the optional `--no-backup` parameter, e.g.:

    ```
    ./install.sh --no-backup user@host\_name customization\_path provision\_path/webresources
    ```

    ```
    ./install.sh root@p-ce-conncr5-01 /shared_content/customization /shared_content/provision/webresources
