# Using the database wizard in silent mode for Oracle {#task_w24_ytw_kr .task}

Run the database wizard in silent mode when you need an identical installation on multiple servers.

Ensure that the wizard has created the response.properties file in the user\_settings/lcWizard/response/dbWizard directory.

To create a response file, run the wizard in standard mode and specify that you would like to create a response file. You can modify the existing response file or create your own, using a text editor.

\(Oracle only\) Ensure that the Statement cache size for the data sources on WebSphere Application Server is no larger than 50. A higher value could lead to Out Of Memory errors on the application server instance.

To create databases in silent mode, complete the following steps:

**Attention:** The HCL Connections 7.0 database wizard does not create the database for the Community Highlights / Connections Engagement Center \(CEC\) or Feature Foundation \| Export entries to PDF and provides support for Tailored Experience. The Community Highlights database scripts are located in the folder - /Wizards/connections.sql/icec. The Feature Foundation database scripts are located in the folder - /Wizards/connections.sql/ic360. Refer to the procedure in this section to create the databases. You will need to manually run the SQL scripts that are provided with HCL Connections™. See [Creating databases](c_install_db_over.md) for more information.

1.  From a command prompt, change to the directory where the wizard is located.

2.  Launch the wizard by running the following command:

    -   Linux®: ./dbWizard.sh -silent response\_file
    -   Microsoft® Windows®: dbWizard.bat -silent response\_file
    where response\_file is the file path to the response file.

    **Note:** If the path to the response\_file contains a space, this parameter must be enclosed in double quotation marks \("\).


After the wizard has finished, check the log file in the dbUser\_home/lcWizard/log/dbWizard directory for messages. The log file name uses the time as a postfix. For example: dbConfig\_20110308\_202501.log.
