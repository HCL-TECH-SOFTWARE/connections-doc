# Moderated content states {#c_admin_common_moderated_states.com .concept}

When content is moderated, it can be in a variety of states before and after being published.

The state that content is in dictates where it is in the pre-moderation or post-moderation workflow and controls whether the content is available to users or unavailable because it has not been approved or is in quarantine.

## Content states before publication { .section}

Content that requires review and approval before it is published can be in one of the following states:

-   Pending: The moderator can approve or reject the content.
-   Active: Content is published
-   Rejected: Content will not be published.

## Content states after publication { .section}

Content that has already been published but requires review, for example, if it was flagged as inappropriate, can be in one of the following states:

-   Active with flags: The content is published but it may be flagged for review. The moderator can dismiss flags or quarantine the content.
-   Active: The content is published.
-   Quarantined : the content is quarantined and notification is sent to the author
