# Administering Activities {#c_admin_act_overview .concept}

Configure Activities to best meet the needs of your environment.

For example, if you have limited disk space, you can specify smaller maximum file upload sizes or decrease the interval of time after which unused activities are marked complete. If you want to gauge how many people are using the product and to what extent, you can collect statistics and retrieve metrics on usage. You can also perform tasks such as synchronizing members IDs between the Activities database and the LDAP server and enabling virus scanning.

-   **[Changing Activities configuration property values](../admin/t_admin_act_changing_config.md)**  
Configuration settings control how and when various Activities operations take place. You can edit the settings to change the ways that activities behave.
-   **[Running Activities administrative commands](../admin/t_admin_act_change_admin_props.md)**  
Use administrative commands to perform tasks that manipulate Activities content.
-   **[Backing up Activities data](../admin/t_admin_act_backup.md)**  
Activities stores data in both a database and the file system. You should backup both sets of data on a regular basis.
-   **[Restoring Activities data](../admin/t_admin_act_restore_data.md)**  
You can restore Activities data to a previously backed up version.
