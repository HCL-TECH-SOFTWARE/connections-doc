# Configuring advanced settings in Profiles {#c_admin_profiles_config_adv_settings .concept}

Configure advanced settings in Profiles by adding information to the <properties\> element in the profile-config.xml file.

For the most part, you can use the ProfilesConfigService.updateConfig command to update settings in the profiles-config.xml file. However, for some advanced settings, you must check out the configuration file and make changes to it manually. For example, if you want to change the display order of the information that displays on the Reporting Structure page or to expose information relating to the following feature, you must use the steps documented in the following topics.

**Note:** For a full list of the properties that you can update using the ProfilesConfigService.updateConfig command, see *Profiles configuration properties*.

-   **[Exposing information about following](../admin/t_admin_profiles_expose_following_info.md)**  
You can add a setting to the profiles-config.xml file to specify whether information relating to the following feature is made public.
-   **[Changing the display order of the Reporting Structure page](../admin/t_admin_profiles_change_display_of_full_reports_to.md)**  
You can add a setting to the profiles-config.xml file to change the order in which the full report-to chain is displayed on the Reporting Structure page.
