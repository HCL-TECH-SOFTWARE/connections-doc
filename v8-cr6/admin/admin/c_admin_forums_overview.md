# Administering Forums {#c_admin_forums_overview .concept}

Administer Forums by specifying properties in a configuration file or running administrative commands.

You can edit the forum-config.xml file to control how and when various Forums operations take place. Use administrative commands to run tasks that manipulate Forums content. Changes to the configuration file require node synchronization and a restart of the Forums server before they take effect. Changes that are made by using administrative commands take effect immediately.
