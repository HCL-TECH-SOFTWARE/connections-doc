# Synchronizing microblog data with Communities {#c_admin_news_sync_data .concept}

Use the NewsMicrobloggingService.exportSyncedResourceInfo command to return an XML synchronization report of the community resources held in the News repository. The report contains information about the current state of microblog data in the community activity stream.

This information can help you to synchronize the microblog data with the Communities database after a system crash that involves data loss. For more information, see *Recovering from a database failure*.
