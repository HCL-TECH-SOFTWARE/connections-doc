# Clearing all scheduled tasks {#t_admin_common_clear_scheduler_after_ltpa_change .task}

Use administrative commands to clear the scheduler of all tasks.

Clear scheduled tasks only if you must re-create all scheduler tasks. If you see an exception that relates to LTPA tokens in the system log before each task runs, clear the scheduled tasks. An exception might occur, for example, after any of the following changes:

-   A new LTPA token is imported into HCL Connections.
-   A new LTPA token is imported from a server in another cell as the result of enabling single sign-on.
-   Reverting the databases from a production environment to a staging environment.
-   Generating new LTPA keys due to a corporate security policy or LTPA timeout.

Do not run the command that is documented here unless the applications are running. The administrative command that is used in this procedure interacts with scheduler MBeans commands. The WebSphereÂ® Application Server scheduler is not application-aware, so if the cluster that hosts an application is running, the scheduler attempts to run the scheduled tasks for that application. The scheduler runs even if the application itself is stopped. Each attempt to run a scheduled task for a stopped application results in an error message to the log.

If you disable or stop an application, cancel any scheduled tasks that are associated with it.

1.  Start the wsadmin client by completing the following steps:

    1.  Open a command prompt and then change to the following directory of the system on which you installed the deployment manager:

        [app\_server\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/profiles/dm\_profile\_root/bin

        app\_server\_root/profiles/dm\_profile\_root/bin. Where app\_server\_root represents the IBM WebSphere Application Server installation directory, for example:

        ```
        Linux:
        /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer
        
        ```

        ```
        Windows:
        drive:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer
        
        ```

        Where drive is the system drive on which the file directory is stored. For example: C: or D:.

        where dm\_profile\_root is the Deployment Manager profile directory; this directory is usually called dmgr01. For example, on Windows, the directory is C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\Dmgr01\\bin.

        **Attention:** You must run the command to start the wsadmin client from this specific directory because the Jython files for the product are stored there. If you start the client from a different directory, the execfile\(\) command does not work correctly.

    2.  Enter the following command to start the wsadmin client:

        -   Linux: ./wsadmin.sh -lang jython -user admin\_user\_id -password admin\_password -port SOAP\_CONNECTOR\_ADDRESS\_PORT
        -   Microsoft Windows: wsadmin -lang jython -user admin\_user\_id -password admin\_password -port SOAP\_CONNECTOR\_ADDRESS\_PORT
        where:

        -   admin\_user\_id is the user name of the Administrator role on IBM WebSphere Application Server. This administrator must be configured at the cell level, not at the cluster, node, or server level.
        -   admin\_password is the password of the WebSphere Application Server administrator.
        -   SOAP\_CONNECTOR\_ADDRESS\_PORT is the SOAP port for the WebSphere Application Server deployment manager server. The default value of the SOAP port is 8879. If you are using the default port value, you do not have to specify this parameter. If you are not using the default value and you do not know the port number, you can look up its value in the WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solution Console. To look up the SOAP port number, complete the following steps:
            1.  Open the WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solution Console for the deployment manager, and then select **System Administration** \> **Deployment Manager**.
            2.  In the Additional properties section expand **Ports**, and then look for the SOAP\_CONNECTOR\_ADDRESS port entry to find the port number.
        For example:

        -   Linux: ./wsadmin.sh -lang jython -username primaryAdmin -password p@assword -port 8879
        -   Microsoft Windows: wsadmin -lang jython -username primaryAdmin -password p@assword -port 8879
2.  Use the wsadmin client to access the HCL Connections configuration files.

    1.  Enter the following command to load the HCL Connections configuration file: execfile\("connectionsConfig.py"\)

        If you are prompted to specify a service to connect to, type 1 to select the first node in the list. Most commands can run on any node. If the command writes or reads information to or from a file by using a local file path, you must select the node where the file is stored. This information is not used by the wsadmin client when you are making configuration changes.

3.  To ensure that all clusters and applications are started and that no scheduled tasks are currently running, retrieve a list of tasks:

    ```
    Scheduler.listAllTasks()
    ```

    From the returned list, determine what to do next by using these guidelines:

    **Wsadmin client message**
    :   **Recommended action**

    Status = running
    :   Wait until the task is completed.

    Skipping app\_name application
    :   The cluster that hosts the application is not running. Restart the cluster.

    Next Fire Time is in the past
    :   If this setting shows a date or time that has already passed, run the `clearScheduler.sql` SQL script as explained in the next step.

    When you list scheduled tasks, output like the following sample is displayed:

    ```
    wsadmin>Scheduler.listAllTasks()
    
           Task Name                 Status  |    Next Fire Time |           Interval

4.  After you complete the suggested actions, run the following command to clear the scheduled tasks:

    ```
    Scheduler.clearAllTasks()
    ```

    If Scheduler.clearAllTasks\(\) does not clear tasks successfully, run clearScheduler.sql manually for each of the applications as follows:

    1.  Open a DB2 Command line:

        ```
        C:\IBM\SQLLIB\bin>db2cmd.exe
        ```

    2.  Navigate to C:\\IBM\\Connections\\xkit\\connections.sql.
    3.  Run the clearScheduler command for each application.

        For example:

        ```
        C:\IBM\Connections\xkit\connections.sql>db2 -v -td"@" -f homepage\db2\clearScheduler.sql
        ```

    The SQL scripts are in the following locations:

    Linux: [connections\_root](../plan/i_ovr_r_directory_conventions.md)/connections.sql .

    Microsoft Windows: C:\\IBM\\Connections\\xkit\\connections.sql.

5.  Run the `Scheduler.listAllTasks()` \(step 3\) command again to verify that all tasks were cleared.

6.  Restart the clusters to force the scheduled tasks to be re-created:

    1.  From the WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solutions Console, expand Servers, click **Server Types**, and then click **WebSphere application servers**.

    2.  Select the check box for one server per cluster, and click **Restart**.
