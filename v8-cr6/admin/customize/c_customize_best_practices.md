# Customization best practices {#c_customize_best_practices .concept}

Use the following guidelines to help you implement and manage customizations in your deployment of HCL Connectionsâ„¢.

Starting with Connections 8.0, the way of applying customizations has changed. For fully functional customizations, the primary and suggested ways of application are now through the [Connections app registry](creating-custom-config-extensions.md) and [Customizer](custom_customizer_about_apps.md). For Connections deployments without Component Pack, you can make [customizations using window-scoped JavaScript](customization-using-window-scoped-javascript-objects.md). Legacy approaches, including those involving use of the customization directory, may not all be fully compatible with the redesigned user interface, though they might still be valid and functional in some areas, such as translation and CSS updates. For more information, refer to [Customizing the user interface](t_admin_common_customize_main.md).
