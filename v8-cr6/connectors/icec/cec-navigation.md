# Navigation {#id_name .reference}

The Navigation widget is working on the same way, like the normal Connections Engagement Center navigation is doing. You can specify to have a right or left alignment navigation. You can also select a specific page from a wiki, instead of showing the full wiki. The selected wiki page will be shown with all their child-pages. If just one single wiki page, which includes children, is selected, only these children will be displayed.
