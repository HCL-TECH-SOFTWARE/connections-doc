# News - Top {#id_name .reference}

Optional highlighting of specific news at a prominent location and extensive display of one single news item.

## Content source { .section}

A Connections community or standalone blog is defined as content source for this widget. The source has to contain at least one blog entry. Since this widget only shows the content of one blog entry, the last created blog entry will be selected. Alternatively, there is the option to select a specific blog entry for the widget.

## Expected format { .section}

The first picture or video, publishing date, headline and abstract of the selected blog entry will be shown.

At a click on the entry an Embedded Experience Pop Up opens up next to the widget. The pop-up contains the complete content of the blog entry, including all comments and likes. Within the Embedded Experience the article can be liked/unliked and commented on. It also contains an **Open in Community** link underneath the article that forwards to the actual Blog entry.

You can also display the latest six entries in a slider. You simply need to switch from **List** to **Slider** in the edit area. Of course you can select any posts you wish. If the option to show more than one post is chosen, the widget displays a slider to navigate the different entries. By checking the **Slide automatically** checkbox \(added with Version 13\) you can make the slider rotate through the blog entries automatically.

You can get the Community title as the widget title by entering **%sourceName%** into the widget title.

**News Aggregation** allows you to add more than one channel into the News - Top widget. This means that you can select more than one community to show news from. The news entries will be shown sorted by date. Of course you can also mix selected and latest posts, if you want to.
