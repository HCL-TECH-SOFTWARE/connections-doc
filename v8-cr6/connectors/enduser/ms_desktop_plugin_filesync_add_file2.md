# Adding a file or folder to My Drive {#ms_desktop_plugin_filesync_add_file .task}

Add a file or folder from your desktop to your My Drive folder so updates made to the content are applied automatically.

When you add a file from your desktop to your local My Drive folder, a copy is made on the corresponding server. The files are synced so that changes made to one copy of the file are also made to the other. If you add a folder, all content in the folder is automatically synced.

**Note:** Syncing is designed for content that you own, or for personal or community files that are shared with you, so the **Add to My Drive** option is not available for community-owned files \(that is, files that are uploaded directly to a community rather than shared with a community\) or library files in a community.

-   Drag and drop a file or folder into your local **My Drive** folder.

-   Save a file to your **My Drive** folder from a desktop application.

-   To begin syncing a file after it has already been added to Connections Cloud or Connections:

    1.  Navigate to a file you uploaded to Connections Cloud or Connections. You can find these files in Windows Explorer under the navigation section for Connections or Connections Cloud.

    2.  Right-click a file and choose **Add to My Drive** or drag a file into your My Drive folder.

        **Important:** Although the **Add to My Drive** menu option is not available for community-owned files, you are able to drag a community or community library file into your My Drive folder. Note that this creates a copy of the file. Changes made to the community file are not synched to the personal copy in your My Drive folder. Changes you make locally are synched.


All files in the My Drive folder stay in sync when changes are made elsewhere.

To stop syncing a file, for example, when you do not want changes that you make to a local file copied to the server copy, right-click a file and choose **Remove from My Drive**. The file is removed from the local sync folder but the local file and the server files are preserved. Note that if a file exists in more than one place in My Drive, for example if you added the file then added a folder containing the file, you must remove all instances of the file to stop syncing.

To suspend file sync and delete the server copy, right-click a file in your sync folder and choose **HCL Connections** \> **Delete from Server**.
