# What is a community? {#c_com_welcome .concept}

With communities, you can interact with people who share your interests.

## What makes a community? { .section}

Communities are groups of people with a common interest. A community with open access is available for everyone in your organization to join, while membership of a restricted community is limited to a particular group. You can also start a community in your organization with moderated access, allowing you to control membership and manage access to the community's resources. Public communities and moderated communities are visible to all users, but restricted communities can only be seen by community members.
