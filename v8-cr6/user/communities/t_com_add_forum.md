# Adding forums to get the discussion going {#t_com_add_forum .task}

You can add more forums to your community to organize discussions around different focus areas. You cannot add existing, stand-alone forums to a community.

Forums that are added to public communities are available from the Public Forums page in the Forums app.

Adding multiple forums to a community provides your members with dedicated discussion areas where they can ask questions and discuss relevant topics.

1.  To add a forum to your community:
2.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community you'd like to add a forum to.

3.  In the community menu, click **Forums**.

4.  Click the **Forums** tab, then **Start A Forum**.

5.  Enter a name and description, and add tags to the forum.

6.  If you want to know about updates to the forum, click the checkbox for **I want to know when new topics and comments are made in this forum**.

7.  Click **Save**.


Community members can start to post topics and questions in the forum. For more information, see [Getting the discussion going in a forum](c_com_forum_frame.md).

Manage forums directly from the **Forums** area on the community's Highlights page. If the Forums app is not added, refer to [Adding apps and widgets to the Highlights page](c_com_highlights_widgets.md).

-   Start a forum topic by clicking **Start a Topic** and completing the form that is displayed.
-   Click a topic title to open it. This app lists the five most recent topic updates.
-   Access a full list of forum topics for the community by clicking **View All**.
