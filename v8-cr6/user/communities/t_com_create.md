# Creating a community to encourage collaboration {#t_com_create .task}

Create a community so that people have a shared hub where they can work on common goals. With communities, you provide a way for users to stay in touch, share files, and exchange ideas.

With the Create Community wizard, you can start a community very quickly. It helps to decide a couple of things beforehand:

-   If you want to display a community logo, have an image ready to upload.
-   Decide which of the following community types fits your needs, based on how restrictive it is:

    |Access type|How can people join?|Who can see this community?|More information|
    |-----------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
    |**Public to My Organization**|People can join without approval or invitation|Anyone in my organization|Multiple public communities cannot have the same name.|
    |**Moderated**|People must request to join|Anyone in my organization|Multiple moderated communities cannot have the same name.|
    |**Restricted and unlisted**|People must be invited to join|Hidden from anyone who is not a member|Multiple restricted communities can have the same name.|
    |**Restricted but listed**|People must be invited to join|Anyone in my organization can see only the community's logo, name, description, and owners|Multiple restricted communities can have the same name.|

    **Note:** There are a few more limitations with user access:

    -   Restricted communities that allow external users are identified by an icon ![This community can have members from outside your organization.](images/ext_user.jpg). If you select to create a restricted community and do not select the **Allow external users** check box, the community will be internal and no external users can be added to it.
    -   You can't invite external users to join public communities.

1.  To start a community:
2.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities**.

3.  Click **Create a Community** and then **Create a New Community**.

4.  Enter the details of your community. The most important is the Community Type, which defines the community's access level. See the previous table for more information.

    **Tip:** For the **Restricted** community type, if you want the details of the community listed, select the checkbox for **Let anyone in my organization see this community's logo, name, description and owners**. If you're not sure, you can always change this setting after you create the community. For more information, see [Changing your community's access level](t_com_edit.md).

5.  Select a template for your community.

6.  To add members, enter their names or email addresses and click the **Add Members** button ![Add members button](images/add_member.png).

    **Tip:** You can always add more members later by using the **Members** tab in the community page. For more information, see [Adding or removing members](t_com_membership_add.md).

7.  Optionally, add tags and a URL short name for your community.

8.  Click **Create**.


Now give members the tools they need to be productive by [adding apps](c_com_add_widgets.md) to your community.
