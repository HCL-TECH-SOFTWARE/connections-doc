# Assigning tasks in a community activity {#t_com_use_activities_widget .task}

Add activities to your community so you can assign tasks to members and share information and resources. You can grant access to the activity to all community members, or you can restrict access to a subset of members.

Creating an activity is a useful way to share to-do items, post event information, and organize meetings within a community. Creating an activity is easy: Click a button and complete a form. There are no required fields. You can edit the activity later to add or change information.

1.  To create a community activity:
2.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to create an activity for.

3.  In the community menu, click **Activities** and then **Start An Activity**. If you're creating the first activity, the button displays as **Create Your First Activity**.

4.  In the **Name** field, type a short name that describes the purpose of the activity.

5.  In the **Tags** field, type a keyword.

6.  Add members to the activity by doing one of the following tasks:

    -   To add all community members to the activity:
        1.  Select **Allow all members of this community access in the activity as** and click the arrow beside it.
        2.  Select **Owner**, **Author** or **Reader**. For more information on roles, see [Assigning app roles for community members](managing_roles_for_community_members.md).
    -   To add a subset of community members to the activity:
        1.  Select **Allow only the following community members access in the activity as** and click the arrow beside it.
        2.  Select **Owner**, **Author** or **Reader**.
        3.  Select the checkbox for each member that you want to add to the activity.
7.  Specify an **Activity goal** and **Due date**.

8.  Click **Pick an activity template** to see a list of available templates.

9.  Click **Save** to finish creating the activity.


After you create an activity, you can add sections, entries, and to-do items. Community members receive an email message to notify them that they are added to the new activity.
