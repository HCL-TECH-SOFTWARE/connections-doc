# Browsing forums {#t_com_forum_topic_view .concept}

Participate in a forum discussion with members of your community.

Members can post discussion topics and respond to existing topics in community forums. You can view recent forum updates in the **Forums** area on the community **Highlights** page. These give you insight on the topics that interest your community and who the most active participants are.

To browse the forums in your community:

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to check on.
2.  In the community **Highlights** page, in the **Forums** area, click **View All**. Alternatively, in the community menu, click **Forums**.
3.  To open a topic, click the topic title from any of the following tabs. A threaded view of the topic displays, showing the original topic and any responses to it.
    1.  To browse by forum, click the **Forums** tab. When you see a forum that interests you, click the forum title to open it and start browsing its topics.
    2.  To browse by topic, click the **Topics** tab. Topics are listed by date, with the most recently created topics first. However, if the community owner has pinned any forum topics, these topics are displayed first.
    3.  To browse open questions that you can respond to, click the **Open Questions** tab.
    4.  To browse questions that are closed, click the **Answered Questions** tab. A question is closed after the author of the topic or a community owner accepts an answer from the available responses.
