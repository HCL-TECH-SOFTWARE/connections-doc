## Adding apps to your community { .section}

With Owner access, you can add one or multiple apps to your community.

**Tip:** Typically, there's a single instance of each app to a community, but you can have multiple instances of the Gallery and Rich Content apps.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to customize.
2.  Click **Community Actions** and select **Add Apps** from the list.
3.  Click the app name or the plus icon ![Add app icon](images/add_app.png) next to the app that you want to add.

In organizations where the HCL Connections for Microsoft SharePoint app is enabled, community owners can add the app to their community so that members can access SharePoint files from there.
