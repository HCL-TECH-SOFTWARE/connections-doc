# Copying a community structure {#concept_trn_ch5_1y .concept}

When you want to create a new community, it might be easier to copy an existing community rather than creating one from scratch.

## What gets copied? { .section}

Copying a community maintains consistency by creating a community with the same layout and structure as the existing community. The following items are copied into the new community:

Description, name, tags, and access settings are copied.

-   Name and description
-   Access settings
-   Tags
-   Moderation settings
-   Apps

    **Note:** Except for the Rich Text app, app contents are not copied to the new community.


## What isn't copied? { .section}

Community members, files, app content \(wikis or blogs content, for example\), and images are not copied to the new community. Settings for apps, such as whether a blog is moderated, are also not copied.

## Copying a community structure { .section}

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities**.
2.  Click **Create a New Community** and select **Copy an Existing Community**.

    **Note:** If you're in a community that you want to copy, you can also click **Community Actions** and select **Copy Community** from the list.

3.  Select a community to copy from the communities you recently visited, or search for a community to copy.
4.  Update the name and description to distinguish your new community from the original. You can also change other details if you want.
5.  Click **Save**.
