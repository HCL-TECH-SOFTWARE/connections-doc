# Joining a community to contribute your expertise {#c_com_join .concept}

Share what you know and inspire others by joining a community that interests you.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the **Discover** tab.
2.  Select the community that you'd like to join, then depending on the community type, do one of the following:
    -   To join a public community, open the community and click **Join this Community**.
    -   To join a moderated community, open the community and click **Request to Join this Community**. Then, make a request to join.
    -   To join a restricted community, you must be invited. To see if you are invited to any restricted communities, click the **Invited** tab, then accept or decline the invitation.

**Note:** Want to keep tabs on a community? Consider following the community to get notified of updates. For more information, see [Viewing updates in your community](c_com_view_status_updates.md).

## What happens next? { .section}

That depends:

-   If your request to join a community is approved, you are notified in Connections and by email.
-   When you join a public community, you can see it in the **I’m a Member** view. For more information on filtering views, see [Searching for and browsing in communities](t_com_search.md).
-   When you request to join a moderated community, it displays in the **I’m a Member** view only after your membership is approved.
