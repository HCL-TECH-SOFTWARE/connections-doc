# Sharing related communities with other members {#t_com_share_related_communities .concept}

If you learn about a community that's of interest, share that information with other members.

The Related Communities app lets you link to other communities that might be doing work that interests your community. HCL Connections already recommends communities to you based on your community membership, network connections, and tags.

To share related communities, a community owner needs to add the Related Communities app to the community. For more information, see [Adding apps and widgets to the Highlights page](c_com_highlights_widgets.md).

**Tip:** Don't share a restricted community as a related community. Only people that are already members can access it.
