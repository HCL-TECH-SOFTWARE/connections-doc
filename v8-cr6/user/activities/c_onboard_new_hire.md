# Onboarding a new hire {#concept_wsl_xf3_yx .concept}

Have a new employee? Onboard them with an activity. You can collect resources like the employee handbook and campus map, create a list of to-dos to get their computer set up, and assemble a list of important people and bookmarks. Put it all together, and you have an onboarding checklist for your new hire.
