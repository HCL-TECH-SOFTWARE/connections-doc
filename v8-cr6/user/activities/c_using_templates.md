# Creating and editing a template {#concept_k1p_4h3_tx .concept}

Find yourself creating the same activity over and over? Never again. Build a reusable template to save your formatting and membership for later.

A new template is an exact copy of the activity that you made it from. All of your sections, entries, to-dos, and who they're assigned to are carried over. You can edit these traits directly from the template, or wait until you start another activity to get revising. Finally, when you finish tweaking, add your template to favorites for easy access.
