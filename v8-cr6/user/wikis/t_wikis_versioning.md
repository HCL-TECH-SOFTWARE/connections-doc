# Managing versions of a wiki page {#whathappenstotheoriginalcontentwhenapageisedited .concept}

When you create a page, an initial version is created. Then each time a wiki member edits the page, a new version is created. With these versions you can restore your previous work, see what's changed from one version to another, or delete a version.

To see the versions of a wiki page, open the page and click the **Versions** tab. The page displays a chronological list of versions with details such as the version number, when it was edited, the person who made the edits, and a link to each version. You can manage the versions in the following ways:

-   **View older versions**. Click **View** for the version you want to check. You can easily switch from one version to another this way.
-   **Compare versions**. Check the differences between two versions by selecting which versions you want to compare and clicking **Show comparison**.
-   **Restore a version**. If you own a page, or have Editor or Owner access to it, you can restore an older version by clicking **Restore**. The restored version becomes the current one that others can update.
-   **Delete a version**. If you own a page, you can also delete versions. In the **Delete all versions prior to version** section, select the scope of the deletion then click **Delete**.
