# What are @mentions and \#hashtags? {#r_common_mention_hashtag .reference}

Use @mentions to notify others of your posts, and use \#hashtags to make it easier to search and filter your posts.

## @Mentions { .section}

An @mention is a method of notifying colleagues of your post. An @mention contains `@username` anywhere in the body of the post. Use the @mentions feature to mention specific colleagues and share your news with them. The mentioned users are notified of your post, even if they are not following you. You can use @mentions anywhere in HCL Connections™HCL Connections Cloud.

@Mentions that specify your `@username` are collected and are displayed in the **@Mentions** filter on your **Home page**. You can only view @mentions that specify your `@username`.

## Rules for @mentions { .section}

-   Symbols cannot be used in or following the @mention. For example, if you enter `@John.123`, your message is sent to the user `@John`, not `@John.123`.
-   The `@` sign must be at the beginning of a post or it must have a space immediately preceding it.
-   @mentions do not work in a typeahead field.

## \#Hashtags { .section}

A \#hashtag is any word or phrase with the number \(`#`\) sign immediately preceding it. The `#` sign converts the word into a link. This makes it easy to find and follow a conversation about a topic. You can use \#hashtags in status updates and in comments about status updates.

To search for content containing a \#hashtag, simply click on the \#hashtag directly from the status update. Or, go to the **Advanced Search** page, select **Status Updates**, enter the tag that you want to find, and select **Search**.

## Rules for \#hashtags { .section}

-   Use \#hashtags only on posts that are relevant to the topic. It is suggested to use no more than three \#hashtags per post.
-   Make sure that you separate \#hashtag entries with a space.
-   The \#hashtag must be preceded by a space. For example, if you enter `123#John` or `word#John`, relevant posts are not displayed in search results for the `#John`hashtag.
-   A \#hashtag can contain any of the following:
    -   Letters and/or numbers
    -   Symbols except for < \> , "
    -   The \# symbol only when it immediately precedes the word
    -   The only symbols allowed at the end of a hashtag are & and %
