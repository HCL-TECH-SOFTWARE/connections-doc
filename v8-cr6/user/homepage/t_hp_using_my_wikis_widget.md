# Using the My Wikis app {#t_hp_using_my_wikis_widget .task}

Use the My Wikis app to help you track the latest updates to the wikis of which you are a member.

The My Wikis app displays a list of the wikis that you are a member of, in order of the most recently-updated wiki. The app lists the wikis by title, and provides information about who last updated the wiki and when they made the update.

-   You can work with the My Wikis app in the following ways:
-   To navigate to a wiki to get more information about an update, click the wiki title to open the wiki in the Wikis app. Close the window to return to the Home page.

-   If there are no wiki entries to display, click **Go to your Wiki page** to open the Wikis app and start a wiki or access other options for working with existing wikis.

-   To configure display settings for the app, see *Managing home page apps*.
