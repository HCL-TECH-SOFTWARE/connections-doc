# Forum moderation {#c_forums_moderation .concept}

When moderation is enabled for Forums, any content that users add to forums is not displayed until it is approved by a moderator.

A moderator for Forums can review and manage forum topics before they are published and review forum topics that are already available. In addition, when forum content is flagged as inappropriate by forum users, a notification is sent to the moderator who reviews the content and decides what action to take.

The HCL Connections administrator can specify whether moderation is managed by global moderators or by content owners. Users who are assigned to the global moderator role can manage forum content from a centralized moderation interface that is available only to them. For more information, see [Moderating content](../eucommon/c_eucommon_global_moderation.md).

When owner moderation is enabled, community owners can moderate community forum content from the community moderation interface. For more information about moderating community forum content, see [Moderating community content](../communities/t_com_moderate_content.md).
