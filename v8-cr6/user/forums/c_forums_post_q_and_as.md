# Posting questions and answers to a forum {#c_forums_post_q_and_as .concept}

Using a forum to ask and answer questions is a great way to share expertise and provide answers to frequently asked questions.

-   To post a question, create a topic and choose **Mark this topic as a question**.
-   To answer a question, create a reply.

    When you answer a question in a forum, the person who posted the question receives a notification with your answer. That person can choose whether to accept or reject your answer. If they accept your answer, the question is marked as answered and is flagged with a tick ![Tick denotes an accepted answer](completed_16x16.gif) to indicate that it is answered correctly. A question can have multiple correct answers.

    **Note:** If you answer your own question, the response is automatically flagged as an accepted answer.


Question topics that are still not answered are displayed on the **Open Questions** tab on the My Forums page. You can view resolved questions by clicking the **Answered Questions** tab.
