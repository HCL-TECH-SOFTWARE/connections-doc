In addition, you can pin forum topics so they appear first in a forum.

Forums can be stand-alone or they can be associated with a community. To create a stand-alone forum, you must add it from the Forums application. Community forums must be added by community owners from the Communities application. After they are created, stand-alone forums cannot be converted into community forums, nor can community forums be converted into stand-alone forums.

**Note:** External users do not have access to the Forums application, but do have access to Forums within Communities. For more information, see the [What can external users do?](../eucommon/c_eucommon_ext_user.md) topic.
