# Bookmark basics {#concept_hkp_c13_hy .concept}

When you're ready to begin using Bookmarks, these basic tasks will get you started.

-   **[Copying a bookmark](../bookmarks/copyabookmark.md)**  
You can copy another person's bookmark into your bookmark list without navigating to the actual web page.
-   **[Adding bookmarks to your watchlist](../bookmarks/subscribetoapersonoratag.md)**  
The watchlist maintains a list of the most recent bookmarks that match criteria you specify. You can add bookmarks to your watchlist that are associated with a person, with a tag, or both.
-   **[Flagging a bookmark as broken](../bookmarks/t_bookmarks_flag_as_broken.md)**  
If you encounter a bookmark that leads to a broken link, you can notify the bookmark owner so that they can repair or remove the bookmark.
-   **[Notifying other users about a bookmark](../bookmarks/t_dogear_bookmark_notification.md)**  
Notify one or more colleagues about bookmarks of interest with an email message.
